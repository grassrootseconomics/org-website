<p>The abuse of monopolistic currency systems has caused generations of economic trauma across the globe and fuels the destruction of our planet.</p>
<p>Historically and today being forced to use currencies created by people outside your community meant you are under a colonial power. e.g <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/14/the-headache-of-crypto-colonialism/">El Salvadorians and people in all Nations should not have to choose between various Crypto and other foreign currencies like USD</a> Instead EMPOWER people to make their own economic systems and connect to others. Communities can create their OWN credit backed by their production and use it as medium of exchange - as has been done for centuries prior to colonization.</p>
<p>The International Finance Corporation (IFC) estimates that 65 million firms, or 40% of formal micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in developing countries, have an unmet financing need of $5.2 trillion every year, which is equivalent to 1.4 times the current level of the global MSME lending.&quot; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/smefinance/">World Bank</a></p>
<p>The current global credit creation system is not able to serve the needs of the masses and foreign crypto would gladly try to fill this space as in El Salvador - while local economic systems and technology need support and regulation - and importantly <strong>economic liberty needs to be understood as a fundamental human right.</strong></p>
<p>There are 192 member states of the UN, all of whom have signed on in agreement with the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> -written in 1948</p>
<div class="section" id="article-22-social-security">
<h2>Article 22 - Social Security</h2>
<p><em>Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realization, through national effort and international cooperation and in accordance with the organization and resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality.</em></p>
<p>Article 22 needs to be brought up to speed in a world that is rapidly changing. Where communities, villages and cities can use technology to create their own systems. Further, it should extend to include the right for communities to develop their own forms of social security, good and service valuation, governance and economic systems.</p>
<p>Dignity demands that people have the means to value themselves and their goods and services. A community (especially without access to National Currency or someone elseâ€™s crypto/token) must be empowered to create their own credit systems - just as they have done for countless generations throughout history prior to colonization.Nation states are encouraged to support regulation of these local economic systems and impose <a class="reference external" href="https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/post/taxation-community-currencies/">taxation</a>  mechanisms - but they must enable people to freely develop their own credit and means of exchange and not be forced into systems that are predatory and that they hold no say or control over.</p>
<p>The mission of Grassroots Economics Foundation is to enable people, groups and organizations to develop local economic systems, in order to trade, share, value, and support collective action. We seek to align grassroots economic systems with long term social and ecological health and declare the following:</p>

<div class="section" id="declaration-of-economic-liberty-and-interdependence">
<h2>Declaration of Economic Liberty and Interdependence</h2>
<p>We recognize the struggle of people forced to use monopolistic currencies and the necessity of people to organize for the establishment of decentralized and interconnected economic systems.</p>
<p>We hereby show our support towards the development of regulations, standards, policies and technologies that enable communities to create their own and connect to other economic systems and safeguard people from the dangers of monopolistic currencies for the betterment of humankind and our harmonious coexistence on planet Earth.</p>
<p>We pledge to provide and support equitable, accessible and inclusive financial systems for all: Money created by the people, for the people.</p>
