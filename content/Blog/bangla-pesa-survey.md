Bangla-Pesa Follow-up Survey - February 2014 Results Two months since
our re-launch in late November. Bangla-Pesa Re-IntroducedResilience and
ingenuity are trademarks of impoverished communities here in Kenya. When
we first introduced Bangla-Pesa it had a few ups and downs, but now it
is being used in ways we had never imagined. We recently completed a
follow-up survey asking members of the business network who are using
Bangla-Pesa about how they are spending it, how they are making sales
with it, and how it is impacting their business. The survey data back up
the apparent success of case studies like that of Marciana.

What Bangla-Pesa is Doing?

Currently 123 surveyed businesses conduct on average 7% of their daily
trades using Bangla-Pesa. Assuming these sales would not have occurred
without the voucher, we can call this a 7% increase in local sales
revenue. And, given that members have actually experienced an overall
increase in sales revenue in Kenyan shillings compared to baseline
data**, we believe these sales in Bangla-Pesa are "new" trades due to
the program's ability to utilize excess capacity. Further, overall
trade for businesses in the network has increased on average by an
astonishing 83% compared to baseline data**. While we don't claim this
increase is solely due to the program, based on interviews, we believe
greater liquidity and stability of the market created by the
complementary currency has helped tremendously, since this survey period
covers one of the worst market seasons of the year. With roughly 9,600
KSH ($111 USD) worth of Bangla-Pesa transacted daily, the increase
growth in the local economy can surpass the cost of the program
implementation in about 3 months! This survey indicates that Bangla-Pesa
not only increases overall trade in the community, but also specifically
increases the trade in the national currency (Kenyan Shillings). This
indicates that the program has measurable benefits for economic
development and could subsides services otherwise provided by county
governments. This shows that empowering communities to issue their own
means of exchange is a simple and effective tool for reducing poverty
and creating market stability by providing a way of trading which can be
used even during harsh economic conditions and market stagnation. We
will continue monitoring the effects of this program over time to see
that these benefits hold true. With more than 2 billion people project
to be living in slums by 2030 and over a billion people living in dire
poverty now, this affects everyone on the planet. Who's Using
Bangla-Pesa? Bangladesh is a community of roughly 20,000 residents. The
business network using Bangla-Pesa has a total of 141 small scale
businesses as members. The "typical" network member is a 35 year-old
mother who identifies herself as the main provider of 2-3 children. She
has never gone to secondary school, and supports her family either by
selling cooked food like flatbread, pastries, fried potatoes, or through
a stand selling fruits and/or vegetables. She earns around 600ksh ($7
USD) a day. Despite long days minding her shop, she also spends 2-3
hours a day on household chores like cooking, cleaning, and childcare.
The market in Bangladesh is extremely volatile, with business reporting
their average daily sales revenue varying from 200ksh (~$2 USD) during
bad periods to 1200ksh (~$14 USD) during good periods, as shown in the
volatility graph.

This fluctuation tells us that businesses could meet a much higher
demand for goods and services (as demonstrated

during good times) than they are during bad or even average per

We keep registering businesses! We know there are more than 200 small
businesses in Bangladesh which are eligible for inclusion in the
network. Given the benefits these initial findings attribute to the
Bangla-Pesa, we would like to register all these businesses. Further,
just over half of the businesses in the network report that there is not
enough Bangla-Pesa in circulation. 200BP per business member is kept in
a community fund for social services. The community will begin using
these funds for health, sanitation, education, or other services,
spending the vouchers into the community and providing more
opportunities for businesses to trade, grow, and meet their families'
needs. As positive findings and reports continue to flow out of
Bangladesh, we hope to one day replicate this program in other
vulnerable informal settlements in the area. We also hope that other
communities are inspired to take up their own complementary currency
programs in Kenya and beyond. What this means for you:

- NGOs and International Aid Organizations. Communities don't need
  aid forever! Helping communities tap into their own abundance is
  cost effective and sustainable, without long term dependence on aid
  funding.
- Local and National Governments. Empower your people! This is a cost
  effective tool to increase local economies and help subsidize the
  need for government funding.
- Communities You can do this yourself! Don't wait for outside
  resource when you can tap into your own.

These findings will be published in more detail in the next few months.

Baseline data collection started in November and continues for new
members. Data were collected by three trained surveyors using Android
phones and Open Data Kit. Report compilation and data analyses was done
by Morgan Richards (M.A. Sociology) and Will Ruddick (M.S. Physics).
