Today's launch of Bangla-Pesa was a great start to an empowering
community process!

137 local business owners attended. Of the 137 local business owners
that attended, 56 members completed their registration and backing
process and created 400 credits each. At least 150 pending registrations
will be completed in the next week.

Prior to the launch, members of the business network processed through
Bangladesh, led in song by the Bangladesh Business Network (BBN)
Committee, and following the Bangla-Pesa basket, which was escorted by
local security officials.

During the launch, the Alpha and Omega youth group performed a drama
detailing the uses of Bangla-Pesa and debunking community concerns about
this relatively novel approach to community development. The dramas left
people laughing, clapping, and better informed. Afterwards Will Ruddick
presented the some results of the baseline data collection, helping
members of the Bangla Business Network understand the size, seasonal and
weekly fluctuations, and gender inequalities in the economy. Members
also listened to speeches by the Committee Chairman and Josephat Kioko,
who talked about the benefits of a Eco-Pesa, the predecessor to
Bangla-Pesa used in Kongowea, Kenya. Then, the Bangladesh Businesses
Network's constitution was read and discussed in detail. Members of the
Network asked pointed questions about issues like voting rules, tribal
equity in leadership, clearly communicating their understanding and
investment in the Network.

Finally, members possessing completed registration forms, with 4
co-signers and the approval of the BBN's committee, received 400
Bangla-Pesa and a marketing sticker for their shops. 200 Bangla-Pesa was
returned by each member as their registration fee. This registration fee
will go toward community activities such as trash collection and health
care, after an initial three month period to first strengthen the
network's use of Bangla-Pesa.

The meeting ended with a hearty meal and a strong commitment to and
excitement about using Bangla-Pesa. Koru-Kenya's monitoring and
evaluation team, led by Morgan Richards, will perform surveys over the
next weeks and months to determine the extent of Bangla-Pesa used, any
problems that need addressing, and how the community has benefited from
the use of Bangla-Pesa. And, in 3 months, the Business Network will have
their next General Meeting to discuss further changes to their operating
rules.
