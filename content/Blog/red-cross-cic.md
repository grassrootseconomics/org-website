After several years of Community Inclusion Currencies (CICs) being used
independently in post Red Cross and WFP intervention sites and a year of
planning, Red Cross began to actively pilot the use of CICs in urban
livelihoods programs in March 2020- which quickly turned into an
improvised COVID response system. By May 2020 a Red Cross field survey
was undertaken to understand the huge increase of CIC transaction data
coming in.

The CIC implementation methodology included: (1) a disbursement of
Sarafu (CIC) tokens to individuals and community groups in the urban
settlement through training carried out by volunteer Community Based
Disaster Response Teams. (2) Additional Sarafu distributed based on
economic data. (3) Purchase of Sarafu using Mpesa from selected
community groups and vendors. (4) Further training was given to
community groups such that they may be able to create and use their own
CIC in the future (this transition is planned for November 2020).

The general theory was that residents need a medium of exchange to
support and trade with each other - especially when National Currency is
getting more and more scarce. By distributing Sarafu and triggering
additional Sarafu injections based on economic data - circulation via
local trade and consumption can be incentivized and aid funds can be
better targeted to multiply impacts.

The survey was carried out by Red Cross staff and volunteers:

- Date of Analysis: 25th to 30th May 2020
- Area of survey: Mukuru Kayaba (Pop. 83,000) (Pop of Sarafu
  users 4000)
- Number of respondent: Female 391, Male 228 Total: 619
- Goal: To understand the impact of Sarafu and give qualitative
  understanding of the statistics for users.

Brief Analysis:

Notably the survey shows significant increases of commerce, food
consumption, impact on income, access to clean water, toilets, soap,
clinics & medicine. On the negative side some users found it harder to
restock their items, and found that merchants would inflate prices when
accepting CIC.

Looking beyond the survey done in May - from transaction and demographic
data we can look back at the year so far as follows:

The above graph shows the trade volume and number of transactions daily
for 2020. The peak of transactions occurred in April coinciding with the
Red Cross pilot in Mukuru as well as COVID reactions starting. Peaks in
enrollments (bottom orange lines) coincide with Red Cross (CBDRT)
enrollment drives. Surprisingly the general shape in terms of volume and
number of transactions has been fairly steady despite a moratorium on
expansion at this pilot stage.

Note that while less than half of CIC users in Kenya are in Mukuru /
Nairobi - similar increases in rural areas outside Nairobi are also seen

- likely due to COVID awareness. Although the percentage of users in
  Mukuru is small comared to all of Kenya their trade number have been by
  far the highest - likely due to Red Cross' CBDRT involvement in helping
  teach users how to trade with one another for mutual aid.

**The impact in Nairobi's Mukuru settlement so far is impressive and
represents roughly three quarters of the total usage in Kenya:** In
Mukuru, we've seen 110,425,747 Sarafu traded between 7,678 users in
143,133 transactions on a blockchain. If equated to Kenyan Shillings in
value, we have witnessed over $1,016,682 USD worth of trade of basic
goods and services among vulnerable populations - at a time when the
economy has been stagnate. This is based on a distribution of 4,745,211
Sarafu (~$43,688 USD) to vulnerable people in the area - seeing this
entire amount changing hands so far ~23 times on average and
categorized by gender, products and locations has given us a huge amount
of insight into the nature and fragility of various markets.

The next pilot stage, where community groups create their own CICs will
be a return to where we were last November when groups were assisted to
create their own currencies. For technical reasons we had to replace all
the previous CICs with their reserve - a single CIC called Sarafu, which
will again be used as a reserve for further CICs in the upcoming months.

While we continue to understand the long term impacts and sustainability
in Mukuru and other areas, Red Cross is further expected to run a pilot
in a new area to try and improve on these results. Should they be
reproducible and sustainable we hope to see similar programs rolled out
wherever Red Cross is dealing with crisis response and recovery. We're
very excited!
