We can't print enough paper notes for everyone who needs them. But
nearly everyone has a phone (without internet). In order to reach a
larger group of people across Kenya, Grassroots Economics has enabled
feature phones with no internet, to have access to, trade and convert
their blockchain-based tokens (Liquid Community Currencies (LCCs)) using
the Bancor Protocol

Community currencies came about as an integrative medium of exchange
that would promote revitalization of the local economy and encourage
community activities. Through the 1990s to 2000s community currencies
emerged worldwide and to date hundreds of community currencies have been
listed in the complementary currency [Resource Center
Worldwide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_currency)

According to [research](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/research) ,
the trade volume of Sarafu-Credit circulating in Kenya since 2010,
covers approximately 12,500 out of 3 million people living in poverty.
These (CCs) which reach users by being airdropped to business owners
across different regions, have helped establish over 1200 local
businesses, schools, farms and co-operatives like Miyani in Kwale
county. They have also enabled households who live on less than a 100
shillings daily, afford at least one meal a day. But trading on paper
meant that we could only have a limited reach.

**How it works:** A business owner receives community currencies from
field officers (as a voucher for that users goods and services), who
monitor and educate the traders on full use of the credits in order to
develop their business and community. This creates a network of
businesses that rely on each other, increasing circulation of goods and
services within the community hence boosting the local economy even when
there are no Kenyan Shillings in supply.

In order to scale and sustain this economic innovation, there needs to
be a means of transaction that:

- Is cost effective without the expense incurred in printing paper
  vouchers
- does not limit the user geographically, hence encouraging trade
  among other businesses in neighboring communities (via Bancor
  Protocol),
- can facilitate an increase in the amount of currency to at least
  offer 2 meals per day, compared to one as it is readily accessible,
- Is cheap for the user without incurring the large transaction fees
- and most importantly one that is both traceable (to measure SDG
  impacts) and scalable .

Grassroots Economics is pioneering the use of blockchain technology
based on the Bancor protocol, which caters for communities at the
Bottom-Of-The-Pyramid in Kenya.

Sarafu Network, it is a decentralized liquidity network that provides
users with a simple, low cost way to buy and sell tokens directly
through their wallets. This platform is the first of its kind to be
USSD/SMS oriented which means that it is user friendly as it can be used
on any phone without needing internet access. After every carried out
transaction an SMS is sent to the user's phone which acts as a statement
of account showing the money sent/received and the balance remaining.
The POA.network blockchain - this guarantees fast transactions, enabling
users to easily monitor their daily transactions, sales and account
information.

Furthermore, Sarafu connects digital currencies to each other across
regions, with automated exchange rates based on productive capacity of
the community.

The use of digital community currency is aimed at bridging the financial
inclusion gap. As an easy method to develop and trade interest free
forms of credit, it fosters economic development in marginalized
communities, by addressing inflation and currency fluctuation in
emerging markets. This curbs chronic poverty and food insecurity the
contributing factors towards zero hunger, one of the SDGs enlisted by
the UN.
