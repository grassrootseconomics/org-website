Empowering women is a great ways to boast our economy . This however
doesn't come without facing challenges of Illitracy among most members.
Many of them lack reading and writing skills and others can't
understand English.

GE finds it's important to support the women and men through Gumbaru
school. By paying 20 sarafu credit money people are able to assist
classes taught by our volunteer Carol where they can learn basic reading
and writing skills and thus be able to carry out daily financial
transaction without any difficulties. The money received for these
lessons is used to purchase chalkdust and pens at LBN shop in Kibera.
