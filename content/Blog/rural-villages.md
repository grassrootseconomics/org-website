Communities can support each other and keep vital food systems and trade
alive using a blockchain based vouchers system (Community Inclusion
Currencies) accessible on any feature phone (no internet required).
12,000 Users have signed up across Kenya to help strengthen their local
communities. Community groups (chamas) in Kenya are being supported by
Red Cross and other donors like DOEN to convert their Sarafu to Kenyan
Shillings. Aid can be provided with Sarafu directly to those who need
it. Please call 0757628885 in Kenya to enroll or find out more.

sales in her community by over 80%.
