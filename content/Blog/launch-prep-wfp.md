Kitui East is a semi-arid region located in the Eastern part of Kenya. Some of economic activities done by locals include; Livestock keeping, bee keeping, farming and commercial business, labor activities such as collection of firewood, door to door laundry services, brick making, trench digging, fencing e.t.c

These communities have been facing challenges due to scarcity of Kenyan shilling, hence many families are forced to forgo meals or receive a reduced quantity and quality, the adverse effect has also shown cases of malnutrition in children.

Water is also a challenge since locals have to trek for long distances to get water.
Communities have also found themselves having accumulative debts which keep people lagging behind economically and in the worst scenarios creates divisions in communities.

To create resilience, Grassroots Economics in collaboration with the World Food Program are currently running a pilot programme on Community Inclusion Currencies (CIC) in Kitui East. Sarafu-Network is a grassroots platform that enables communities to develop their own vouchers redeemable as payment for their own goods and services and as a general medium of exchanges to support the community when national currency is scarce will help create strong and resilient communities.

Sarafu-Network, was introduced in Kitui East sub county through an inception meeting which was attended by county stakeholders i.e Local chiefs, county commissioners, representatives from the ministry of agriculture, WFP and Word vision representatives.

Inital tarinings have began in 4 wards in Kitui east i.e  Zombe/mwitika, Mutitu/kaliku, Endau/malalani, Voo/kyamatu.

Through demonstration games and the usage of Sarafu (a free voucher created by Grassroots Economics on Sarafu-Network) community members have practically gained first hand experience of how they can use the CIC within their community to trade basic goods and services they all offer.

In Kitui East, these communities have existing groups consisting of about 15- 25 members who come together to do activities such as table banking and other activities that  support one another e.g farming. 
Since the introduction of Sarafu-Network in Kitui, members have made their meeting days better by creating a market where each individual carries goods/Services which they sell/buy and pay partly using Sarafu.
At the end of the day everyone goes back home happy with something they can feed their families whilst reducing debt baggage.

Above is a photo of the Great vision group with samples of goods they carried to trade during their meeting day.

These groups are practicing and developing ways similar to ancient practices inorder to share and trade their resources among each other fairly even when Kenyan shillings are scarce. They are currently in the process of creating their own vouchers which will be backed by goods and services each member commits. We are really excited to learn how people Kitui will own and utilize these governance tools.

Another success story is from Mr Richard Matibo posho mill owner and  a member of Great Vision group.He is happy to have attended two Sarafu-Network training sessions and gained  lots of knowledge. As part of the training period, currently Mr Richard’s milling charges are 10 Sarafu for 1kg  millet and 5 Sarafu for 1kg of maize the rest of the balance can be paid in KSH.



Braiding doesn't stop there as he also needs to spend. 
This network includes ;

* Kavutha Nzuki - a hotel owner who is still a member of Great Vision. She is willing to accept Sarafu for tea,chapati and other food stuff.
* Christine-A grocer and a member of Great Vision is also part of Mr Richard’s network.

Everyone from this circle knows the importance of setting limits on how much Sarafu they can receive and spend on a daily basis.

Other community members have gained interest and chama members are continuing to create awareness about the the creation of Vouchers.

These are just some of the stories from Kitui - Voo ward. There is more happening in other parts of the Sub-county. We are happy for the few months we have been working in Kitui empowering communities to recognize and share their own abundance.
