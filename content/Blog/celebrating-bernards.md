Bernard's vision of diverse monetary eco-systems that support
communities and the environment rather than extract from them, as they
continue to do now, is the spark that moved me from physics in the US
into economics in Kenya and is still the vision that motivates me and
countless other community currency developers, researchers and
activists. His vision preceded crypto currencies by decades. Back then,
the only way we could move toward Bernard's vision was by trial and
error -- creating currency after currency using paper bills or
centralized databases.

I met Bernard Lietaer for the first time while implementing a small
paper-based community currency program in three villages near Mombasa.
He understood all the heart-wrenching challenges of fighting poverty and
embraced me, knowing that the vision was true and we were doing our best
with the sticks and stones we had to use. He spoke of Yin and Yang flows
of different currencies for spending and savings and much more. The
intricate dance and balance of these currencies working together was so
tangible to him that you could feel it flowing through his whole being.

Connecting those early community currencies together into the ecosystem
he envisioned wasn't possible without blockchain. Bernard was convinced
that solutions like bonding curves which allowed currencies to
communicate with each other through and across blockchains was the key
to scaling and viral growth. With Bernard as President of the Bancor
Foundation and his ability to cut through the sensationalism of
blockchain to its potential to empower humanity to develop sustainable
and healthy monetary ecosystems -- there was and is no place I would
rather be. When asked to direct the foundation's efforts on community
currencies under his guidance, it was a dream come true. It was a great
honor to walk in his footsteps and without him it is a great loss to me
personally and sadly his dream of what Bancor could be ended.

The world has lost a visionary that inspired and united people to fix
fundamental flaws in our monetary systems, which are the root causes of
poverty and massive human and environmental strife. As we thank him for
opening the doors and dedicate our work toward his vision, let us ensure
his message continues to flourish and inspire future generations -- that
we banish the concept of monetary monoculture and embrace the values
that are within each of us as the fundamental units of a diverse
ecosystem of currencies that connect us all together in love and allow
us to heal our planet and ourselves.

Sincerely with Love, Inspiration and Celebration of a life well lived,

Will Ruddick
