Dear Friends and Colleagues,



 



We are happy to announce that we have won a precedent-setting court victory which legitimates community currencies as a development tool in Kenya! Finally, community currencies are free to spread, empowering people in slums to take charge of their local economies.



 



How? By removing the key barrier to trade – lack of money.



 



Through community currency programs, people have the are able to issue their own currency within networks of small businesses. This breakthrough allows people to access interest-free credit in the form of vouchers issued by the community, without being locked into unmanageable debt. And the results are immediate—increased sales and market stability.



 



Over the next month, it is crucial that we raise funds to leverage program development at this unparalleled time in history.





We are poised to change the face of aid in Kenya and beyond as we scale these currencies to any and all communities with unstable markets from credit shortages. We need your support to lead this poverty reduction revolution.



 



This is not aid as you know it. Together we can create sustainable change that will make a difference for many generations to come.




Please make a donation of at least $50 dollars to give women like Marciana the power to trade through a community currency, despite her poverty, or market conditions. We will be happy to mail you samples of the currency created by the community as well as artwork, and pledge to keep you informed about the change your donation creates.
