Election violence broke out in areas across Kenya this year and was
concentrate in the lowest income areas. There is still a lot of
uncertainty and much of Kenya's economy is still in what people call
Post Election Syndrome where the usual amounts of money coming into the
slums isn't because larger markets have been disrupted.

Lydia Anyango reporting from Mombasa:

The streets of Mikindani and Bangladesh are almost empty. It is not
usual to see these streets like this. They are normally flocked by
people buying, selling and others just running up and down. This is what
we call Post Election 'Syndrome'. People have fled to upcountry for
'safety' while others are just indoors. It clear that the recent
elections and current political situation has caused serious economic
instability.

Khadija a woman selling vegetables is known by most people in the
community. Regardless of the post election economy, she still opens her
business very early in the morning. I ask her if she is not worried of
getting into loss if her mboga doesn't sell, "I am not worried and in
fact I'll sell it all before you know it. I don't only depend Kenyan
Shillings. Here we use Ng'ombeni-Pesa (NP) especially at a time when the
economy is down like now," she says. "Why should I worry when I can also
use community currency to meet my daily needs?" She adds. Khadija wishes
that the whole country embraces the use of alternative currency so that
people won't worry and would still meet their needs when the Kenyan
Shillings goes down.

In Bangladesh, I come across this old man, Francis Muyula. He looks
happy and you might wonder why, yet he if just a cobbler. I sought to
know why. In Swahili Mr Muyula says, "Mimi sina hofu kwa sababu hata
kama hakuna pesa ya Kenya, siwezi lala njaa kwa sababu mimi natumia
Bangla-pesa kununua chakula". (I am not worried even though I don't have
Kenyan shillings now because I have Bangla-Pesa (BP) so I cannot sleep
hungry.) He says that his customers are from the Bangladesh slum
community so they pay him with BP which he uses to buy food within the
community.

Despite the situation rolling over the country, the economy of the
Bangladesh community seems not to have received as strong blow.

The community in Mombasa have been trading using Sarafu Credit (SC) for
almost four years and to them trade goes on as usual even when the
Kenyan currency is low.

Daniel Mukosia reporting from Nairobi:

Rebba Nyarotso in Nairobi does bead work and tailors sweaters and
scarfs. She started using Community Currency more than one and half
years ago and is actively trading using Gatina-Pesa. She has increased
her profits by gaining more sales and customers who are part of the
business network.This has enabled her earn profits that made her expand
her business. This year when the elections were held on the 26th of
October, violence erupted in Kawangware areas (Stage 2,Congo, 56 mwisho)
among others. The impact of this resulted in shutting down most of
Nairobi's slum economies. If it had not been for the community currency
users Rebba says she wouldn't have been able to buy food. Mama mboga
were no where to be found and she made no sales,no transportation was
easily available and if it was,then it was beyond her reach.
