On October 25th, Will Ruddick along with Galia Bernartzi from Bancor
addressed a packed audience at the UN regarding the potential impacts of
blockchain technology enabled Community Currencies, on marginalized
communities world wide. This was a ground breaking moment to show case
the ability to connect currencies, to each other and the world, with
automated exchange rates.

Grassroots Economics Foundation pioneers the use of blockchain
technology in Kenya, where communities will have the autonomy to create
their own Liquid Community Currencies (LCCs) and trade among themselves.
With no internet access needed, this block chain technology will reach
millions of users by SMS/USSD creating a decentralized financial system.
This empowers economic development practices, that enable communities to
develop and trade their own interest free form of credit; backed by
their own productive capacity.

In lieu of creating exchanges between communities, Bancor offers a smart
contract that allows Liquid Community Currencies to automatically trade
with one another across markets. By virtue of this, LCCs will be able to
develop thriving economies.

Themed "Blockchains for Social Impact, at the UN Geneva," Will Ruddick
([The Pioneer of Community currencies in
Kenya](http://www.grassrootseconomics.org/media)) presented research
from Universities worldwide on impacts related to Grassroots Economics'
Community Currencies and the shift to blockchain technology which
enables large data sets of transactions to be analysed.

He exemplified how this technological development offers a platform to
engage people currently outside the formal financial system, mentioning
that, " Through Block chain Liquid Community Currencies address the
financial inclusion gap existing among people underserved by current
financial solutions."

Galia Benartzi, Bancor reinforced this by stating that, "It is unlikely
that the money system that created the need for the SDGs is the same
that will be able to solve them. We must think outside the box." She
says. Bancor alongside Grassroots Economics was mentioned as the leading
example of Blockchain usage for Sustainable Development. It was
positioned as the infrastructure to enable the next +10,000 Currencies
for Sustainable Development and Grassroots Economics as the implementer.

This exciting week at the UN provided a platform to validate how the
implementation of blockchain technology in Kenya by [Grassroots
Economics](http://www.grassrootseconomics.org), will increase local
trade and overall economic stability by addressing multiple derivations
targeted by the UN. Many NGOs were interested in setting up Liquid
Community Currencies as they realized it was possible to track
Sustainable Development Goals through transparent blockchain technology
hence offering real solutions to worldwide problems.
