We are very happy to announce that today, for the first time in our
organizational history, the community currency members of the Nairobi
programs registered themselves as a cooperative: The Sarafu Cooperative.

We started these 3 groups back in 2015 in Kibera, Kangemi and
Kawangware, and we are very proud to see that they have successfully
come together to form a powerful cooperative which will preside over 2
wholesale markets and 3 community currency networks.

Today was their first official meeting and the handing over of their
registration certificate. We look forward to continue to capacity build
them and support them throughout this process. It is extremely exciting
to see cooperatives utilizing community currencies for economic
resilience, sustainability, marketing, regional development, food
security and community cohesion!
