The Gatina Business Organization is busy preparing for the community currency's official launch on October 11th. Children from the community are preparing songs and dances while a group of local youth are preparing dramas. Gatina-Pesa membership has surpassed an initial 100 local prosumers including: schools, baby care centers, beans, spices, shoes, internet cafes, clothes, barbers, salons, flour, tailors, fruit, vegetables, soap, entertainment, cooked foods, photography, fish, charcoal, electronic repairs, and more. Each local good and service provider must also be a local buyer of goods and services and backed by four other community members.



After a wonderful design process with local students in Kenya and Nyendo-lernen as well as the Cheimgauer in Germany the Gatina-Pesa have been printed and are on their way to Kenya. Hopes are high and there is a strong commitment to seeing this program take off.
