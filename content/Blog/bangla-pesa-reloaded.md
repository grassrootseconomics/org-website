We've been waiting since May 29th 2013 for this and it is finally here.
Bangla-Pesa is back moving through the community. We've re-registered
from scratch 100 members so far, since the official relaunch. The newly
designed Bangla-Pesa just arrived in the mail today (to replace those
that the police took and refused to return) - featuring a shiny
hologram. Our team has also been working around the clock to reestablish
a set of baseline data so we can gauge the programs impact. Registration
and allocation of Bangla-Pesa will continue over December and we hope to
see a positive shift in January's market stability.

January is when schools fees are due. These fees generally empty the
community of scare national currency - so we hope to see and measure
(via our M&E Specialist, Morgan Richards) Bangla-Pesa starting to fill
this gap by allowing the business community to trade their underutilized
goods and services.

We're also happy to have the support of several churches that will be
accepting tithing in Bangla-Pesa and using it for community services.
There is a strong sense of community building and the beginning of
something beautiful.

We are also happy to congratulate Caroline Dama and welcome her back
home after representing the team and winning the top innovations in
Africa award in Paris last week.
