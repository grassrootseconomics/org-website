SMEP a local OIKO-Credit partner is offering Loans and Training to
Community Currency users in Kangemi and Kawangware. They have started
with a group of women centered around the headmistress Veronica of Love
School in the Congo Area of Kawangware, Nairobi. These women run a soap
business called the Love Soap group which consists of 15 women. They are
being trained and guided by Audrey from SMEP, on how to apply for loans
to expand their business. The entire network using Community Currency is
keen on following suit with their own businesses.

Yesterday there were about 30 members from two different community
currency trading groups (Gatina-Pesa and Kangemi-Pesa) present at the
1st major Loan financing meeting. The meeting generally went very well.
Audrey, from SMEP, explained how the group loans work and members got to
ask questions concerning the payback period as well as interest rates.
Audrey took contacts of the already registered Groups/Chamas within the
networks and shall be contacting them soon; an action that has made the
rest of the business members want to get into groups as well - a good
challenge.

The kind of package SMEP is offering is indeed a group loan but being
issued to an individual. The group therefore acts as a guarantor/backer
for the loan. SMEP also has packages that issue loans to entire groups
rather than individuals but these are usually bigger loans meant for
larger projects such as purchasing land and buildings.

In other news - Francis Wanjala reports: the Gatina Business
Organization (GBO) has issued loans to 5 members using Community
Currency (Gatina-Pesa) of roughly 30k. In their previous meeting the
members started paying back the loans and the GBO has so far received
Ksh.9500 in repayment, which is quite exciting. These members reported
that the money has helped to boost stock.
