Two neighboring schools St. Peter's & Paul's and St. Angeline are
being trained and equipped to design, build and maintain a community
food garden and tree nursery for mangrove restoration using permaculture
techniques. A group of local businesses (The Bangladesh Business
Network) will support the program by helping to provide labor and
purchasing produce from the garden using a community currency
(Bangla-Pesa) that can also be used for paying school fees and for local
goods and services. The sustainability of the program comes from its
ownership by the schools and integration into a larger network of
businesses, schools and parents using a community currency called
Bangla-Pesa. One of the challenges of community currencies is that they
depend on backing of local goods and services. If all vegetables come
from outside the community this limits currency circulation. Hence
developing a good garden is a great import replacing business that
drastically reduces the transport needed for distribution. This Monday
and Tuesday the community held a ground breaking ceremony and begun
digging swales to prevent erosion. These swales will be filled with
manure and grass and let to compost until school restarts in January -
when roof water catchment will be installed and the garden will be sewn
with nutritious vegetables. The community will also be reforesting a
mangrove forest at the base of the schools. We hope this model of
community school garden will be a great success and replicated in all
our community currencies. We greatly appreciate all the support for this
program from the Permaculture International Public Fund based in
Australia.
