## New Impact Reporting mechanism with Sarafu.Network

![image](images/blog/sarafu-reports1.webp)

At Grassroots Economics, we’ve always been dedicated to enhancing community resilience through ancient and innovative financial and resource coordination tools. For years, we relied on field validators and WhatsApp groups to track community activities, but keeping records and ensuring transparency was a challenge. Now, with our new impact reporting system on[ Sarafu.Network](https://sarafu.network/reports), everything is streamlined into one transparent and accessible platform! \



### **Another tool in the toolkit for Community Coordination**

With this new reporting mechanism, **anyone can document their activities** utilizing community asset vouchers and commitment pools. In just the last month, we’ve received over **100 reports** from different community groups, showcasing efforts in **rotating labor traditions, house construction, agroforestry work, and environmental restoration**. These reports also contribute to **certifications for water catchment and soil regeneration**, reinforcing the impact of community-led sustainability initiatives. Note that each report is validated by a Grassroots Economist before being approved for the website. Contact us if you want to learn how to do that yourself.


### **The Numbers Speak for Themselves**

In just one month, the Sarafu.Network platform has seen the following types of activities recorded:



* **Agriculture & Food Systems**: 35 reports
* **Reforestation & Soil Regeneration**: 22 reports
* **Construction & Infrastructure**: 18 reports
* **Community Governance & Leadership**: 9 reports
* **Water Catchment & Erosion Control**: 7 reports
* **Waste Management & Cleaning**: 12 reports
* **Training & Education**: 5 reports

 \
Each of these reports represents a window into coordination practices that are both ancient, time tested and being paradoxically revived after years of suppression. \
 \
Note that the usage of the digital vouchers on [https://sarafu.network/dashboard](https://sarafu.network/dashboard) shows 16097 Peer to Peer transactions over this same 1 month time period! \
 \
Grassroots Economics Foundation consists of a small core team for software and field work of 5 people that simply develop and teach Grassroots Economics and groups how to use the tools. Anyone can pick-up the free tools and start gardening - by pulling together a network of local service providers.


### ** \
Three Key Instruments on Sarafu.Network**

The Sarafu.Network platform is built around three essential instruments for resource coordination:



1. **Commitments** – Vouchers and certificates for past and future work.
2. **Pools** – Systems that connect digital resources, including vouchers, certificates, and stable coins to enable seeding and exchange.
3. **Reports** – Attestations and verifications of completed community-driven tasks.

This coordination and accounting mechanism is now being **used globally**, spreading the foundational principles of **curation, valuation, limitation, and exchange** in resource pooling systems.


### **Highlighting Outstanding Community Efforts**

Here are a few inspiring reports showcasing how communities are utilizing these tools to build resilience:



* **Making Compost** (Upendo Group) – 16 members collaborated to assist a community member in compost preparation.
* **Nursery Management & Reforestation** (Chasimba Caves) – Local groups maintained indigenous and exotic tree nurseries, contributing to reforestation and food security.
* **Water Retention & Erosion Control** (Mnyumbuni Demo Farm) – Implementation of check dams in indigenous forests to combat soil erosion.
* **Mud House Construction** (Mnyumbuni Neighbors) – 15 members united to dig soil for a new mud toilet, improving sanitation.
* **Harvesting Green Grams** (Wikwatyo Group) – Collective farming efforts led to a successful harvest, ensuring food security.
* **Community Governance & Leadership Elections** (Madzibu Group) – Conducted transparent elections for leadership roles.
* **Cleaning & Waste Management** (Mafanikio Group) – Organized garbage collection and sorting for recycling and environmental sustainability.

### **The Era of Community-Led Development**

The shift to **transparent, decentralized reporting** through Sarafu.Network represents a huge step forward. By documenting and verifying local efforts, communities can **strengthen their resource coordination, gain recognition, and plan for future initiatives.**

We encourage everyone to explore the reports and see firsthand the remarkable work being done. If you’re part of a community group, **start documenting your activities today** and contribute to a growing movement of resilience and shared prosperity!
