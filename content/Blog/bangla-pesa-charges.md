THE CASE IS OVER! Today the Director of Public Prosecutions
[announced](http://grassrootseconomics.org/files/Bangla-Pesa-DPP-statement-1024.jpg)
that all charges against Bangla-Pesa are hereby dropped! This is a huge
success for Bangladesh and for poverty reduction programs in Kenya. We
are incredibly grateful for the huge amount of support in Kenya and
around the world. Without it, this program could have easily been
forgotten and the accused held in prison. There is no doubt that we are
part of an International Complementary Currency movement that is growing
daily!

**What does this mean for Bangla-Pesa?**

- That there are no laws in Kenya that have been broken by this
  program.
- Before re-launching the program we are waiting on two things:
  confiscated Bangla-Pesa to be returned from the Central Bank, and
  official government recognition of the program.
- Community Meetings will commence next week to get begin the process
  of putting Bangla-Pesa back to use.
- We are asking for continued support of these programs, as
  communities around Kenya and East Africa wish to duplicate the
  successes of Bangladesh.
- With the support raised so far via Indiegogo we hope to finalize all
  legal matters and relaunch the program with detailed monitoring and
  evaluation over the coming years.

Why is Bangla-Pesa so important? As a poverty reduction program,
Bangla-Pesa points in a new direction for community development by
fundamentally re-thinking our means of exchange and how it issued. It
gives those living in dire conditions the ability to create their own
means of exchange and stabilize their own economy.
