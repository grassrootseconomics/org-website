2014 has been an intense year developing the structures to allow
community currency programs to one day become accessible across Africa.
Besides our currency programs we have also worked with hundreds of
street living youth in Kenya, to help them reintegrate with society.
We're looking forward to 2015! In 2014 we:

- continued to monitor the first and now vibrant community currency
  program in Kenya. Looking back, our first award winning pilot in
  2010 Eco-Pesa gave us the tools to implement and develop Bangla-Pesa
  starting in 2012 Via mutual credit backing and circulating vouchers.
  Bangla-Pesa has enabled over 3 million shillings worth of trade in
  an impoverished informal settlement in Mombasa. We've measured as
  much as an 80% increase in sales revenue in the community during
  poor market conditions, through better utilization of excess
  capacity and interconnectedness between small over 300 informal
  businesses.
- Set a legal precedent by defending our programs in court.
- enabled networks of businesses to save Kenyan Shillings for
  investment and cooperative enterprises.
- duplicated Bangla-Pesa now in Nairobi's Kawangware informal
  settlement with Gatina-Pesa(named after Gatina location where it is
  centered.) There are 4 schools in Mombasa and 4 so far in Nairobi
  accepting community currency for school fees, helping to raise and
  stabilize teachers salaries.
- established community currency as a low cost innovation that can be
  spread to communities across Africa
- collaborated with and trained the FLOW team in South Africa to
  implement in two municipalities in South Africa, which will launch
  community currencies in mid 2015. The team in South Africa led by
  John Ziniades and Anna Cowen from Cape Town are doing amazing work.
  The teams of FLOW Ambassadors that they are creating to help
  implement these programs along with their support from local
  municipalities really set them apart from other CC programs.
- presented community currencies at an international

In 2015 we will:

- Form a foundation to help establish legislation, expand research and
  implement more community currency programs.
- Start another 4 currencies in Kenya (2 in Nairobi and 2 more in
  Mombasa Counties) Thanks to Lush Cosmetics and DOEN!
- Assist in 2 more currencies being implemented in South Africa
- Assist local government to be able to monitor and manage community
  currency programs.
- We hope - find the support to create an office for East Africa
  promoting community currency programs.
