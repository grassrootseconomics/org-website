Martin Kimani is still spinning it up since 2009! The MotoMoto Circus
programhas been working to reach street living youth through performing
arts since 2009 when the project was given a kick start from Burners
Without Borders.

This week we had our Wednesday training and showcase at Makadara Grounds
in Mombasa. These kids are trying to change their habits, support
eachother and get off drug addiction and the streets. Martin is our lead
instructor and works with different groups of street kids multiple times
a week. We are also hoping to start a prison program in 2013 to reach
those youth that are in jail often being subjected to hard labor.

Besides the great help we get from Burners without Borders. We are
looking for help with donations of kevlar and old poi sets. If you are
able to donate a [roll of
Kevlaror](http://www.homeofpoi.com/shop/listItems/KEVLAR-Wick-Flat) any
other poi stuff that would be great!

We are also looking for volunteers in 2013. If you can teach poi or want
to learn poi - think about doing it in Kenya!
