The Ng'ombeni-Pesa Community Based Organization has been formed. They
are a neighboring slum to Bangladesh in Mombasa County and live in a
devastating situation. Ng'ombe means cow in Kiswahili and Ng'ombeni
means the place of the cows. Sadly there have been no cows in this area
for nearly 20 years, and it now forms an area with the cheapest housing
in Mombasa. (No utilities, and poorly built mud houses, with rusting
iron sheets.) But there is a vibrant group of (mostly) women business
owners who want to change all this.

At our 3rd large scale community meeting on April 18th 2015 we talked
with a potential 50 new members of the group that represent schools,
churches and many small businesses. At the meeting four pieces of art
that had been based on requests from the community were presented. The
art was created by our own Carol Opondo, the artists for Bangla-Pesa,
and the results are stunning. There are four themes for the four
denominations of vouchers that will be used as the community currency.
The themes are community, environment, education and economy; since the
community currency ties them all together to improve livelihoods.
