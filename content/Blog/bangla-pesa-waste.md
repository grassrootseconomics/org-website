**Community Waste Collection**

This weekend the Bangladesh Business Network, the more than 180 people
who trade their goods and services with Bangla-Pesa, came together to
start a regular community cleanup. They swept and collected community
waste to a municipal waste collection area. Youth participating in the
event were rewarded with Bangla-Pesa from the community fund to which
each member contributes. Equipment, like rakes and wheelbarrows, were
also rented using Bangla-Pesa.

After the cleanup, the community celebrated with a volleyball match and
much laughter during light afternoon rains.

**Study**

A major study is nearly completed with interviews of each of the
businesses using Bangla-Pesa. In a recent interview with several female
business owners, participants reported that each time they used
Bangla-Pesa for a purchase, they saved their Kenyan Shillings increasing
the funds available to pay their children's school fees. These and
other indicators suggest a steady improvement in this large, but
marginalized community though the simple, cost effective tool of
community currencies.

**Nairobi's Bangla-Pesa**

About 8 hours away by bus, three communities from separate sub-locations
in the Kangemi and Kawangware slums of Nairobi started their first
community discussions on creating their own Bangla-Pesa program. These
communities will create business networks similar to the Bangla Business
Network in Mombasa County, issue their own community vouchers, and use
increased revenue to support tuition costs of children in surrounding
schools.

Alfred Sigo and Will Ruddick did three workshops in Nairobi over the
last week and are excited to see the community there taking the program
into their own hands.

**Fundraising**

We ended our yearly crowd fundraising, raising nearly $3,000 USD. While
this was only a fraction of our goal, we are extremely grateful for the
chance to keep going even on a shoe string budget. If you didn't get a
