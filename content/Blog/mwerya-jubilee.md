### The Mwerya Tradition Returns to Kinango

In the heart of Kinango, a small community in Kenya, something remarkable has taken place. After the jubilee ceremony that marked the successful completion of their first cycle on Mwerya, the community was awakened to the power of the ancient community practice that had long been forgotten. The revival of the Mwerya tradition has brought about a transformative change, uniting the people and paving the way for a more sustainable and self-sufficient future. Mwerya involves a group of people commiting to rotational mutual service.

### Jubilee Ceremony:

As the first cycle of Mwerya came to an end (a full rotation where everyone in the community recieved the support of others), a jubilee ceremony filled the air with excitement and gratitude. Al debts were settles and the various groups that had partaken in this revival were deeply impressed by the impact of the community labor Merry-go-round, sparking a renewed interest in continuing the practice. This tradition, once an integral part of the community's fabric, had been overshadowed by modern practices (using scarce Kenyan Shillings). However, its revival brought back a sense of unity and purpose to the people of Kinango.

### A Sustainable Path Ahead:

With newfound enthusiasm, 21 groups in Kinango have already embarked on their second cycle of Mwerya. The significance of this revival cannot be overstated, as it offers a holistic approach to address various community needs.

### Grassroots Economics Foundation: The Catalyst for Change:

The driving force behind the successful resurrection of the Mwerya tradition is the Community Asset Vouchers (CAVs). These vouchers (with training from Grassroots Economics) played a crucial role in guiding and supporting the community throughout this journey. By introducing the concept of Community Asset Vouchers as a means of expressing commitment and appreciation during Mwerya practices, they have empowered the people to save Kenya shillings for other essential expenses, thereby alleviating financial burdens.

### Unearthing the Benefits of Mwerya:

The impact of Mwerya extends beyond its economic benefits. As groups come together to work towards common goals, a spirit of cooperation and unity has blossomed among the community members. Sharing their expertise and labor to aid each other in farming, constructing houses, and planting trees has fostered a sense of solidarity that transcends individual interests.
