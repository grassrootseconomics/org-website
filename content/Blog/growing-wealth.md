Hello, I’m George Shungu from Kiriba Village. I want to share with you how our small community has been transforming the way we grow, share, and steward resources—together.

In our village, we formed the **Kiriba Group**—a circle of 20 neighbors who meet twice a week. These gatherings are never long, but they’re deeply powerful. We come together to coordinate labor, support each other, and build resilience. And thanks to **Sarafu.Network**, our efforts are more visible, more impactful, and more connected than ever.

## A Transparent Tool for Trust and Learning

Sarafu.Network runs on the Celo blockchain, but to us it’s more than technology—it’s a mirror of our values. Every time we plant trees, repair infrastructure, or manage our shared water sources, we document the work on Sarafu. This reporting builds accountability. I can see who’s been active and how each contribution supports the whole. Everyone can see. There’s no hiding, and no need to second-guess. That openness builds trust.

But Sarafu isn’t just about tracking—it’s also a way to learn. We’ve discovered practices from other groups across Kenya. One example that changed everything for us was the **Zaipits method** from the Guro Group in Kinango. It’s a simple regenerative farming technique that enriches the soil. We learned it through Sarafu, adopted it, and saw our yields improve dramatically. That’s the power of shared knowledge.

## Simple, Clear, and Data-Rich

What I love most is how easy it is to see what’s happening. I can log in and instantly check what activities we’ve done, who took part, and how our group’s collective assets are growing. No paperwork, no stress. It’s all right there.

Sarafu’s interface lets me track our work over weeks, months, or seasons. I can filter by project, see our progress, and compare ourselves to past efforts—or to other groups. This is more than just documentation—it’s a reflection of our growth.

## Wealth Beyond Money

Through our work with Sarafu, we’ve realized that wealth isn’t just about shillings and cents. It’s about what we build together. Through **rotating commitments**, we pool our time and energy to restore forests, build community infrastructure, and share skills.

We’re growing:

- **Natural Assets** through reforestation,
- **Physical Assets** like roads and water tanks,
- **Social Assets** in the trust we build,
- **Human Assets** in the skills we pass to each other,
- And **Governance Assets** as we learn to make decisions collectively.

This is the economy we believe in—one rooted in care, not competition.

## A Platform for a New Kind of Future

To us, **Sarafu.Network is more than a platform—it’s a bridge**. It connects our efforts to other communities, to shared wisdom, and to a bigger story of mutual resilience. It’s not just about the money—it’s about remembering how powerful we are when we act together.

If you’re part of a community that wants to move from scarcity to shared abundance, I invite you: **come see what’s possible with Sarafu.Network**. You don’t need big money. You just need trust, commitment, and a willingness to grow—together.
