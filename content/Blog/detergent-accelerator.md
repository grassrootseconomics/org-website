Julius Nyelele has been a member of Lindi Business Network for more than
one year. He is a roadside seller of washing detergents and body jelly.
He says that, at first he never understood the concept behind community
currency, but later when he actively started using Sarafu-Credit he got
more customers who are part of the Business Network. He has been selling
most of his products along the road since he didn't have a place to
store his products, but currently he has a host of ready customers who
are part of the business network that always purchase his products using
Kenya Shillings and Sarafu-Credit (Community currency). He says that his
products are always first moving now and that's increasing his sales and
savings. He is also starting to use the community super market space to
store his products and has expanded his business to selling larger
quantities.

Julius is benefiting from increased connection among the members and
businesses of his community. By virtue of hundreds of shops receiving an
interest free credit to use among each-other in an area overall
efficiency greatly increases. Instead of waiting on Kenyan Shillings to
make a purchase, members of these networks can trade using credit that
is readily available. These networks also develop assets, like
supermarket stock, that backs the credits (community currency) in case
of defaults and to grow the credit supply.
