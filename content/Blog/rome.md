As time marches on, many indigenous cultural practices that once shaped our communities are fading into obscurity. Yet, there are pockets of resilience where these traditions are not only surviving but thriving. One such tradition is the practice of **Rome** _pronounced (with an ’ay’ ending like Romay, Dhome or Thome in different clans)_, deeply embedded in the social fabric of the Mijikenda people, particularly among the Duruma subtribe.

**Rome** is a practice of profound cultural significance, serving as a cornerstone for moral education and community planning of the **Kaya** (home, society, sacred forest). At the family level, it was a sacred time when the grandfathers and men of the house gathered his sons around the fireplace to impart wisdom, while the girls learned from their mothers and grandmothers. These sessions were not just about learning to cook or keeping warm by the fire—they were about absorbing the history and values that would guide them through life.

At the village level, Rome took on a broader scope, often involving representatives from **chamas** (community groups). These gatherings were critical in planning the next cycle of **Mweria**, a traditional system of rotational labor where community members pooled their efforts for collective projects. The discussions were intense and purposeful, ensuring that commitments from the previous cycle were fulfilled and setting the stage for the next round of community work. These gatherings also served as a forum for addressing community needs, from building houses to improving infrastructure.

The full day agenda of a Rome looks something like:

1. Call and introduce people (A Rome can be called on regular basis or as needed)
2. Sing and Dance, visit the sacred Kaya forest
3. Start Cooking - The location of the Rome should rotate and each new host to provide food
4. Storytelling and learning songs and weaving and drinking. Emphasis on morals, leadership and history
5. Eating and sending children off to sleep
6. Serious discussion, settle disputes and debts and Mweria Planning, 
7. Sing Dance Drums
8. Continued discussions can go on till morning.

While the Mweria tradition acts like the heart of the Kaya - pumping resources through the community, Rome is like the head or brain, learning, planning, and settling disputes. Where we used to work with communities around a Jubilee tradition we’ve found that Rome includes such debt settlement in a more holistic way. 

Recently, I had the privilege of experiencing this tradition firsthand. Together with Will Ruddick, Aude Peronne, and Kahindi Emmanuel, we packed our tents and ventured into Kinango in Kwale County to fully immerse ourselves with groups seeking to revive the practice. The experience was nothing short of transformative. Beyond the planning of community projects and the organization of Mweria with over 10 different chama representatives, we were enveloped in the rich tapestry of Mijikenda culture—the music and dance, the stories shared around the fireplace late into the night, and the laughter that bound us together. These memories will stay with me for a long time.

What makes this tradition even more remarkable is how it is being revitalized in the modern era, thanks in part (I am proud to say) to our work at Grassroots Economics together with strong local teams. Today, the practices of **Mweria** and **Rome** are being formalized using digital vouchers, which can be created by anyone at[ Sarafu Network](https://sarafu.network/vouchers/create). These vouchers are more than just a digital token—they are commitments made by community members to build houses, till farms, construct roads, fix fences, and much more. They represent the enduring spirit of mutual aid and collective responsibility that has always defined these communities. Rome has re-emerged as the place where the communities pool their vouchers and maintain a commons of shared commitments.

As we move forward, it is essential to recognize and celebrate the resilience of these traditions. By integrating ancient practices with modern technology, we are not only preserving our cultural heritage but also ensuring that these practices continue to serve the communities that depend on them.

Let us continue to support and participate in these traditions, ensuring that the wisdom of our ancestors guides us into a future grounded in community, cooperation, and shared prosperity.
