Nairobi's first community currency Gatina-Pesa, following
Bangla-Pesa's success has started circulation with vigor. Due to its
dense population and size the area of Nairobi's Kawangware is really
showing potential as an alternative trading hub.

Each day more and more small business owners are able to trade with each
other even when they don't have 'money'. This program grew out of
schools like Sifa Children's Center who are accepting Gatina-Pesa for
their tuition. In one virtuous circle - parents can pay for part of
their children's school fee; teachers then make better and more stable
salaries; teachers use the Gatina-Pesa to buy goods and services from
the parents in the community and the parents use the funds for tuition
again.

Will Ruddick can be seen on the right giving a seminar at the University
of Nairobi, with the hope that more research will focus on these
alternative financial programs.
