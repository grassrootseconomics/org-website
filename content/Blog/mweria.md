When a community comes together to help one of its members and then helps the next members in a cycle; this practice is today called merry-go-round in Kenya - where members contribute money all to one member at each meeting. Sadly when people don’t have national currency the merry-go-round falls apart yet this practice is ancient and existed before national currency. Before national currency as we know it a community would help each other raise a barn, till land, fix a roof and so on. This was called different things by different tribes in Kenya: Kikuyu,: Gubato Kamba: Mwethya, Luo: Nyoluoro, Mijikenda: *Mweria*, Mweri-roho safi, Jiba, Hisa

*Mweria* is an ancient social contract of mutual aid – there is a debt to be paid by the person receiving the support – which is paid as they help others. It is a beautiful form of reciprocal exchange.

Following these ancient practices and bringing in transparent double entry accounting, groups (chamas) have been expressing their capacity to help each other in a mutual commitment (a group voucher or Community Inclusion Currency (#CIC)). When the group comes to support one of the members – the member receiving the *Mweria* (Mwenye mweria) gives the group vouchers (which represent that person’s debt to the group) and then when that person helps at the next *Mweria* they accept the vouchers in return (redeem them) as payment for their services (coming back to a balance of trade).

This integrates the modern money-based merry-go-round with the older *Mweria* and enables the holders of these vouchers to also use them in-lieu of barter trade(currency) and as well as a way to raise funds, i.e. such vouchers can be sold at discount by individuals or the group in order to raise funds needed.

If we think of mutual aid as a form of social contract or *promise* that is re-assignable (meaning that the voucher issuers are still liable for redeeming it but anyone can hold it as an asset) – then the *Mweria* becomes a form of group-promise which can be used for both crowd funding and a medium of exchange. When incorporating demurrage (holding taxes) into the social contract, groups also have a way to ensure that no one person accumulates too many vouchers – since a percentage of voucher holdings come back to a community fund over time. Note that the usage of promises (social contracts or vouchers) which can be made, accepted create a trust based economic system which we often call an economic commons.

Experimenting with digital forms of *Mweria* is what thousands of Kenyans are doing right now. Groups can also have a Mweria among groups! Where different villages can support one another and track reciprocity. We’ve seen 3,958 transaction among and between groups last week and they look like [this](https://viz.sarafu.network):

So rather than purely a merry-go-round cycle that depends on national currency groups in Kenya using voucher/CICs are able to account for mutual aid without scarce Kenyan money while also using these vouchers as both a medium of exchange and crowd-funding tool. For instance groups are using vouchers a way to track who from the chama is working on communal farms (as in the first image). Learning from the traditions of *Mweria* helped us as Grassroots Economics remember that land leasing/ownership is a colonial construct vs stewardship and rotational farming/community support which been the norm for millions of years.
