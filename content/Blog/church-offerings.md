Faith based organizations (FBOs) are beginning to step up their usage of
Bangla-Pesa to increase community services. FBOs act as a conduit for
community service when members of the Bangladesh Business Network use
their Bangla-Pesa as an offering. The Legio Maria Church in Bangladesh
(shown on the left) today took offerings (Sadaka in Swahili) in
Bangla-Pesa. These Bangla-Pesa will increase the amounts the church
collects on a weekly basis and be used to help feed community members
with HIV/AIDS as well as support other community activities. The Legio
Maria church puts hundreds of children through school and helps many in
the community make ends meets.

After being active again for a few weeks the lists of goods and services
members offer for Bangla-Pesa is growing rapidly. The trade of
everything from produce and cooked foods, to shoe and TV repair, is
increasing as the community becomes more knit together into a barter
network.

As the community finds more ways to trade with each other, they also
find more ways to give. Local faith based organizations struggle to
raise funds for many basic programs, like feeding and schooling
children. By accepting Bangla-Pesa as offerings they are allowing
community members to contribute through their goods and services rather
than scarce national currency. Needy community members then receive
these offerings from the church, and can then spend it in the business
network. This circular flow is one that both strengthens the local
economy and provides a means for the community to help meet their own
needs.
