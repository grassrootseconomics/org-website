June 6th 2015 was bound to be a typical morning in Kibera - but Saturday
morning, the inhabitants of Kibera, the biggest slum of Nairobi, saw
their daily routine disturbed by the sound of children, tamtam, klaxons
and a megaphone when a vibrant and empowered group marched through the
streets, cheering and distributing flyers about something called
"Lindi-Pesa".

The march was organized by the Lindi Business Network to raise awareness
in the community of Kibera about Lindi-Pesa, the third community
currency of Nairobi that will be launched in the coming months. The
group already has over 120 small businesses pre-registered and waiting
for the launch!

The group that attended the march was composed of members of Lindi
Business network that answered the call of the committee members
equipped with a megaphone, pupils from member schools, a group of
drummers and a dozen boda-boda's (motorcycles). Members of the
committees of Kangemi Business Network and Gatina Business organization
were also there to represent the already existing currencies
(Gatina-Pesa and Kangemi-Pesa).

The march across Kibera was 3 km long and the lasted two hours. The
businesses along the way were given flyers about the community currency
and the chairman lost his voice speaking through the megaphone! The
walkers were very energetic and even the rain didn't stop the older
members of the troop from dancing to the rhythm of the drums.

Once the destination was reached, the chairman of Gatina Business
Organisation, Francis Wanjala and Lindi Business Network George Owino
gave a speech and the participants were offered drinks bought from one
of the member. We warmly thank Citizen Radio for covering the event -
And also the participation of Nyendo-lernen. Two German students, part
of Nyendo-lernen, attended the event, one of whose hands are part of the
design of the Lindi-Pesa itself!

The march was a success and we hope, as the chairman of Gatina Business
Organisation told the participants of the march, that the Lindi-Pesa
will surpass in users and dynamism all the other currencies launched so
far.
