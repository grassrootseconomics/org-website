The [Schumacher Center](http://www.centerforneweconomics.org/) for a New
Economics has supported us with inspiration and advice since we began
with Eco-Pesa in 2010. Before starting our first currency, Eco-Pesa), I
called Susan Witt (the Executive Director of the Schumacher Center) for
advise, from one of those little international calling booths they used
to have in Mombasa at 70 Kenyan Shillings a minute. The Schumacher
Center is a pioneer in developing local currencies with their
[BerkShares](http://www.berkshares.org/) a historic and leading example
of a regional currency in Massachusetts. Susan told me the of the
efforts over the years to get BerkShares flowing and that, while
successful in so many way, it was continuing to evolve. She made it
clear that developing community currencies in Kenya wasn't going to
follow a cookie cutter approach and that grit and hope would be my best
companions.

Seven years later, The Schumacher Center's patient advice has paid off.
Through hardship and collective action, we have developed Community
Currencies in regions around Kenya and trained groups in South Africa,
Nigeria and Uganda. We were lucky enough to develop on the lessons of
the Schumacher Center and apply those teachings to a Kenyan setting.
Now, in turn, groups, NGOs and municipalities are using our programs as
a model for resilient community development across Africa. We train
communities to develop cooperative businesses that form the foundations
of a community currencies and enable communities to develop resilient
economies that can withstand seasonal market volatility and more people
out of poverty. Since 2010 we've worked with over 2000 businesses,
community groups, schools and clinics across Africa to develop
cooperative businesses and 8 regional community currencies.

We believe that communities should be afforded the same privileges as
nations and empowered to develop their own prospering economies with the
stability of their own currencies. Because of our shared purpose, we are
happy to announce that the Schumacher Center has agreed to serve as a
sponsor of Grassroots Economics' work in Africa. Donations are therefore
