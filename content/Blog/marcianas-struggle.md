Marciana's husband died a long time ago, leaving her with 5 children to
care for alone. Even though she is 64 now, and most of her children are
grown, she still bears the burden for caring for her family. Her oldest
son, who might have taken on this responsibility, also died, and her
oldest daughter is disabled from a bout of TB. Her surviving son was
trained as a driver, but he's been unable to find work, so he, his wife,
and his two children live with Marciana, along with Marciana's disabled
daughter and youngest daughter (17 years). Marciana didn't have the
money to send her youngest daughter to secondary school. And, although
she received some training as a tailor, she is also unemployed. So,
Marciana supports this household from the sale of porridge and a bean
and maize soup. The porridge sells for 15ksh ($0.18) and soup for 10ksh
($0.12). She usually makes around 600ksh ($7) a day to feed a family
of 7. Technically, this puts her above the international poverty line
based on the lower cost of living in Kenya, but, as she leaned her
forehead against a pole, looked down at her worn red flip flops and dust
covered feet, and told us about her life, we could feel the exhaustion
caused by her efforts to keep her family fed and housed, and some
sadness at being unable to keep her daughters in school and in good
health.

Things are improving for Marciana now. She became a member of Koru's
Bangladesh Business Network in December and started trading the
Bangla-Pesa voucher with fellow members. "I take 200 Bangla-Pesa every
morning to buy sugar from Mwololo to make my porridge. When I get
customers, I will buy fish and then that lady will come to buy my
porridge. The same happens when I buy potatoes and water. They all come
to get my porridge and I take from them their goods too." All of these
trades happen between members without Kenyan shillings, which means the
money from trades which do use Kenyan shillings can be saved and used
for other kinds of purchases. Further, when there are larger economic
upheavals, the Bangla-Pesa can provide a buffer for the business
community. In an effort reduce illegal hawking, and more comprehensively
tax small businesses, the local government in Mombasa cleared out many
shops in the central business district and in the market area. This left
many businesses in Bangladesh without access to their stock, which they
used to purchased from in now destroyed shops in the central market. In
response to this disruption, Marciana and her customer used Bangla-Pesa
to keep business going. "When the market was closed, I was only working
with Bangla-Pesa, because that was what people had." People couldn't
buy stock as usual, had fewer products to sell, and so had very few
Kenyan Shillings. But, they could still use Bangla-Pesa to buy some
stock locally, sell the processed stock for Bangla-Pesa, buy food and
necessities with the vouchers and maintain a basic standard of living
until they adjusted to the changes in the central market.

When we spoke with her, Marciana had 400 Bangla-Pesa after a day of
trading. The next morning, she would take half that to buy sugar and the
rest to buy food and water for herself and her family. As soon as
customers come to her, she will repeat the process of using Bangla-Pesa
to meet whatever needs she has, "I get it [Bangla-Pesa], then I use
it. I used to be without food because we wouldn't have enough Kenyan
Shillings, now I can eat even when I don't have the Kenyan Shillings
because I still have the Bangla-Pesa to use." Every day, businesses in
Bangladesh close the business day with goods unsold (some of which will
spoil) and services unsold because their fellow businesswomen and men
lack the funds to purchase these services. Bangla-Pesa provides a way
for businesses to trade this excess capacity among each other. Then,
everyone can fully meet their demand for goods and services locally and
save their Kenyan Shillings to access medical care and education. We are
truly excited to hear more from Marciana and others about how their
community currency is helping them raise their standard of living
together.
