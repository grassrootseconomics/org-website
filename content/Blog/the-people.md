Ndegwa lives in Peku, a rural village in Western Kenya, and supports his
family of seven by selling peas and chicken to the community. The area,
he explains, is challenged by seasonal droughts. With a high dependency
on agriculture as a main source of income, he believes that this is
perhaps one of the reasons why poverty, unemployment and food insecurity
are considerable challenges in his community.

In early 2019, Ndegwa started covering his daily expenses with not only
Kenyan Shillings but also Sarafu. Sarafu is a network of community
currencies operating in several slums and marginalized rural communities
across Kenya. The community in Peku is using the local Sarafu token
called Miyani, which is one of the most active in the network. Charging
other users half in Kenyan Shillings (and the other half in Miyani),
Miyani has helped Ndegwa to provide greater access to his products, gain
more customers and save Kenyan Shillings for bigger investments beyond
his daily consumption.

The Sarafu Network is one of the first community currencies to switch to
a digital, blockchain-based model and make it work on the ground. In the
last eight months, more than 4000 users have set up a Sarafu wallet and
have traded up to 500,000 Sarafu tokens per week. When the network of
community currencies went digital, last year, it allowed its users to
exchange Sarafu on any type of phone and in-between participating
communities. Thus, making a prime case of how digital community
currencies can help create resilient local economies in practice.

Sarafu usage compared to household income in Kenyan Shillings differs
widely across its users --- some users seem to be substituting almost
all of their income with Sarafu, others only a small percentage. The
average Sarafu user in Miyani has around 5 other businesses they trade
with and has made, rather irregularly, about 24 transactions in the past
eight months. Ndegwa is part of a smaller, more active circuit of users.
With an average of around 150 transactions per user this smaller set of
users is driving the Sarafu trade volume (Diagram 1).

Mary is an agent in Ndegwa´s community. She uses Sarafu to generate a
source of income by facilitating the community to exchange Sarafu and
Kenyan Shillings back and forth.

Besides her, three other family members support her family by working in
agriculture. The users in Miyani and Peku come to her to exchange their
Kenyan Shillings for Sarafu to be able to buy the community-produced
maize flour once their own stacks of maize have run out and to save
Sarafu in their savings groups. To her it seems like Sarafu has been
given the specific role to facilitate the trade of both maize flour and
treated water within the community.

Sarafu appears to mobilize the local food and agriculture sectors.
Almost half of the Sarafu trade volume is directed to users selling food
and water (Diagram 2). Particularly, locally farmed products,
vegetables, fish and traditional pastries are top items to be traded. In
a small sample of 21 Sarafu users we find that on average 7% of the
monthly food products are purchased with Sarafu and 1% of their monthly
water expenditure is substituted with Sarafu.

The Food Consumption Score (FCS) provides a common measure for food
security that integrates dietary diversity and the frequency of food
consumption weighted by the relative nutritional importance of the food
consumed. According to the FCS over half of the users of the same sample
show consumption patterns that are considered borderline or poor. Daily
consumption of oil and sugar are very common. Meat, fish and vegetables
can only be accessed on an irregular basis, thus, leaving most of the
consumption to the main staple, maize. A community currency like Sarafu
opens up new channels of local trade and help facilitate access to
nutritious and sufficient food, thereby, supporting the Sustainable
Development Goals from the bottom-up.

"Sarafu represents the people in Miyani and more people are needed so
that we can do more business and save in our chamas (savings groups)"
reports Dzame during her interview in Yowani, a village within walking
distance to the main market in Miyani. The data across the 21 user
profiles suggests that the Miyani Token provides a fruitful economic and
social environment for a community currency to foster new avenues of
exchange. Dzame is among the majority of the Sarafu-users interviewed
that have lived in and around Miyani for more than 20 years. Almost all
sell self-produced goods such as food, water or firewood to the
community and their share of goods and services bought within the area
is extremely high. Whilst this suggests rather traditional and stagnant
economic patterns, it may be the closed economic loop that provides the
necessary grip for a community currency to circulate more seamlessly and
thereby stimulate local production and consumption.

Both, the maize mill as well as local water tanks, have been externally
placed into the community to seed local demand. A community farming
project connected to a cooperative mill generates a maize reserve for
the community and provides a good example for how agriculture projects
can be connected to a complementary currency like the Sarafu Network.
This suggests that using a local medium of exchange to facilitate
collective farming can make a firm foundation for sustained local access
to food. However, community currencies only become a long term
sustainable tool themselves once the local circulation no longer depends
primarily on a single business like the externally supported maize mill.

Going digital not only opens up a range of new, unexplored ways to
exchange with each other but also allows us to learn about the inner
workings of a community currency and how it can help communities address
the challenges they face. With the field of digital community currencies
still being relatively new, Sarafu provides a rare opportunity to trace
exchange relations and study how community currencies impact the local
economy and address under-utilized resources. How will the duration of
usage and size of the network affect Sarafu? How are Sarafu and the
Kenyan Shilling working alongside each other? And which complementary
currency designs ensure just, equitable and self-sufficient
implementations? Testing and understanding these questions are some of
the exciting ways in which researchers can support community communities
on the ground and help build networks of local thriving economies.
