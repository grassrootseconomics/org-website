It is sad to announce the sudden death of Dominic Okello (in the middle)
who passed on early May 2017. He is a resident of Bangladesh community
and also an active community currency member. He has been trading with
Sarafu Credit since he joined the network in 2013 and has been a great
inspiration to other members of the BN and through his stories he was
able to entice others to join the BN.

The two BN in Mombasa (Ng'ombeni and Bangla) have come together to
support the family of the late.
