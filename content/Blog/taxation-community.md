This is a touchy topic! One that is the last thing a lot of community
currency designers often want to think about, yet the first question
they are asked.

While in most regulatory regimes, _right now_, a community currency
(CCs) is nothing more than a tradable voucher. Taxation on these
vouchers is similar to trading any crypto currency - a grey area at
best. When exchanging CCs or any crypto currency for National Currency
is when you begin to enter the current tax regimes. I say _current_,
because things change fast in this space and actively thinking about how
taxes could or should be imposed, collected and redistributed is
extremely important. Below are some concepts on taxation of CCs that
should be considered.

Community Currencies are about giving people the right to issue their
own credit and use it as a medium of exchange - often filling the gaps
left by low liquidity and hoarding of national currency. There is an
obvious tension here with governments seeing CC trade as productive
activity and/or utilization of public services, going un-taxed.

Generally community currency creators don't want to end funding to
governments that provide useful services but we do want to make sure
people have a say in how taxes are spent! In the case of Grassroots
Economics - we are a non-profit foundation trying to provide a way for
people to live together without the constant fear and trauma of monetary
scarcity.

**Demurrage** on currency is a simple concept: currency decay over time
(such as holding tax as a percentage deducted from all balances). This
idea was created by the economist Silvio Gesell and first implemented
Austrian town of Wörgl in 1932 with great success. It was created in
order to reduce hoarding and encourage people to invest in local
productive capacity - leaving currency as a medium of exchange and less
of a form of savings. Rather than using paper currency and the purchase
of stamps to keep your currency valuable, as was done in the 1930's we
can use modern technology such as blockchain to create complete
transparency and automation of tax collection. To use demurrage as
taxation digitally today - this holding tax can be collected
automatically using blockchain smart contracts and deposited into a
public contract or Demurrage decentralized Autonomous Organization
(DDAO). Anyone holding the currency would have a right to vote on the
DDAO to determine where their demurrage goes. Governments could regulate
these DDAO contracts to ensure a percentage goes to them - and they as
well would be taxed on any unspent funds.

In the above diagram you can see a community creating a **Community
Inclusion Currency** (CIC) as a claim against their future production.
Such a CIC could also be issued by a government or municipality as in
the case of Wörgl against redemption in government services. These CIC
tokens could intrinsically be taxable into a DDAO and a portion could go
to local government while the rest goes back to the CIC users
themselves. The CIC collected by government would have to be used or be
taxed back into the DDAO and be again redistributed. This creates a
virtuous cycle where local taxes are automatically collected and must be
re-spent locally. Such a CIC tax could even be reissued by government as
a **basic income**. Social service organizations and charities could
show their CIC transaction volumes in order to convince the public and
government to allocate (vote) CIC tax redistribution to them.

Rather than only allowing banks and government to create our money
supply - CICs give an option to decentralize credit issuance while
preserving the functions of government to collect taxes and support
social services. Governments - both local and national - that understand
the power of credit decentralization and automated taxation, should see
that this could be the largest and most sustainable funding source
imaginable especially in countries like Kenya where the vast majority of
businesses are informal and paying no taxes at all.

In the above video the Red Cross has introduced a CIC into a sub-county
of Mombasa. Every token (Sarafu) has a 2% a monthly demurrage (holding
tax) that currently collected automatically and is redistributed to
active users in the community. Over 3 Million USD of trade has happened
on this network and nearly 20 Million Sarafu tokens have been issued
nation wide to over 56,000 households. **If the county or national
government were to accept locally created credit for local taxation via
automated demurrage it could pay for roads, schools, health services and
even basic income to support those in need.**
