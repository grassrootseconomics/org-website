Since transitioning our technology onto the Celo blockchain in July 2023, Grassroots Economics has scaled its Commitment Pooling Protocol, transforming community-driven economic models across multiple regions. This protocol enables communities to issue **Community Asset Vouchers (CAVs)** and engage in **Rotational Labor (Mweria)**, where individuals and groups pool commitments to facilitate trade, access credit, and foster business collaboration.

As of September 2024:
- Groups have established **33 commitment pools** on Sarafu.Network, creating new channels for capital seeding, credit and local trade.
- These pools support localized rotations of labor, resulting in tangible outcomes such as agroforestry improvements, water conservation, and community infrastructure.
- **239 unique Community Asset Vouchers** (also known as Community Inclusion Currencies) have been issued by individuals, groups, and businesses, benefiting **3,149 monthly active users** globally.  

Sarafu.Network is revolutionizing how communities collaborate, access credit, and build resilient economies.

# Key Growth Metrics:

* **Total Monthly Active Users**: 3,149 
* **Total Pools Created**: 33 pools facilitating credit, trade, and collaboration ([Sarafu Network Pools](https://sarafu.network/pools))
