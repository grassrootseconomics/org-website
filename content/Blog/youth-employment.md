Using a basic income (Sarafu in Kenya) youth can support their elderly
and vulnerable by giving them their Sarafu. Then those
elderly/vulnerable in turn spend it with other youth run businesses, who
could in turn give it to their elderly/vulnerable - who could, in turn,
spend it on other youth run businesses and so on - **Creating a virtuous
circle of markets and employment for youth and support for the
elderly.**

While new in Kenya, this type of system has been around in Japan since
1995 and is called [Fureai
kippu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fureai_kippu) . This system was one
of the inspirations for bringing the concept of community currency to
Kenya over 10 years ago. While this has been piloted in small
communities - for the idea to really catch on - elders, chiefs, youth
run businesses and chamas all need to understand the virtuous circle
created and keep supporting it. This support network is a commons - and
it takes identification, communication, training and care. We're very
excited about the Kenya Red Cross taking up the challenge to spread

youth can support their communities and their own families using Sarafu
