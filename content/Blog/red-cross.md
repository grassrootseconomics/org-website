Below are a compilation of Community Inclusion Currency (CIC) user
stories from Grassroots Economics Field Support Engineers (_Emmanuel
Mbui, Amina Godana, Janet Akinyi and Joyce Kamau_) supporting and
working with Red Cross volunteers and community groups. Implementation
with Red Cross volunteers led by _Bahero Mohamed_ through door to door
awareness raising and street theater began in January 2021. The
following case studies are taken from the week of April 23rd 2021 and
their successes continue to ripple out across the region. While Kisauni
is only a small part of Kenya; through word-of-mouth over 50,000
households and small businesses in vulnerable areas have registered to
be part of the Sarafu Network since 2020 and have traded roughly 3
Million USD of goods and services among each other using a blockchain
ledger - on simple phones without the need for internet.

Economic imbalance, insecurity, dependency and luck of money are the
challenges experienced by most people in Kisauni. Thanks to Red Cross,
partnering with Grassroots economics foundation for introducing CICs,
Community Inclusion Currency (locally Sarafu or 'currency' in
Kisawhili); a medium of exchange that builds trust and unites members of
a community. Sarafu helps people pool the locally available resources
and provides a fair space for exchange within the community.

In Kenya, Mombasa County, Kisauni sub county, in Manyani village, we
find Jackton Mwema (pictured above), a tailor in his community. Jackton
spends most of his time mending other people clothes. By doing this, he
is able to support his family from the little cash he gets. Like any
other member in his community, Jackton is not an exception to economic
trauma which is why he joined the Sarafu network. He is now linked to
other members of Sarafu within the community who have other goods or
services (Fresh water, vegetables, shops) to offer to one another.

Jackton at his place of work in Manyani village accepts payment in
sarafu for the service that he provides, which he latter spends it to
buy other goods and services from other members in the community.

Jackton is not the only one who benefits from Sarafu, in the same
village of Manyani, we meet another beneficiary. Victoria Kylo. The
owner of a small Duka (shop) in the village, she joined the network and
accepts a small percentage of the payment in Sarafu. Victoria is in the
same trading circle with Jackton and other members. Victoria uses her
Sarafu to buy mboga(vegetables) and services like repairing her clothes
from Jackton and to buy cold water from their neighbor.

The two have also manage to invite other people in by explaining how
Sarafu works, giving a testimonial example through themselves. Now their
trading group has four active members.

Due to Covid 19 Pandemic and its effects on the economy at large, most
of the people have not been able to cater for their basic needs. The
ones greatly affected being the vulnerable in the community. A ray of
hope was brought upon these communities with the introduction of
Community Inclusion Currencies which helps them get their basic needs
and has also helped them in minimizing debt collection which was a great
challenge to them. Here are some testimonials from different users in
different locations.

Mshomoroni Area in Mjambere Ward: Its an area where the local economy is
not that sustainable this is because most of the young and able youths
have engaged themselves in illegal activities such as theft and high
level of insecurity in the area. This is due to financial trauma. This
has however begun to change with the introduction of community inclusion
currencies since anyone can accept and use Sarafu even when they do not
have a business. He/she can offer services in the community and be paid
with CIC and later spend on other business.

Here are some testimonials of users who have benefited with the usage of
sarafu in the area.

Mwanahamisi Kiti: A mother of three who sells Samaki (fish) by the road
side is very grateful for the introduction of Sarafu to her business she
says she can now get the daily needs this is because there is an
increase in customers to her business and the sarafu she gets she can
comfortably buy charcoal from Patricia Munyaka who is her immediate
neighbor. (She also spends her sarafu to buy groceries from Irene Matoke
and buy Utensils from Suleiman Mohammed.)

Patricia Munyaka (pictured above): She is the bread winner of her family
has a small Makaa (charcoal) business which she says the sales have
increased when she embraces the sarafu concept. She further explains how
she has reduced debt holding in her business which was a major challenge
to her but now she accepts sarafu instead of debts. This has greatly
helped her business in terms of restocking. She uses her sarafu to buy
fish from Mwanahamisi Kiti and also accepts sarafu from her and also
buys groceries from Irene Matoke.

Irene Matoke (pictured above): She runs a grocery kiosk she was
introduced to the system by Mwanahamisi Kiti who shared her success
story with her. Upon hearing this she was excited and joined the network
with no hesitations since she was a witness on how sarafu has helped her
friend Mwanahamisi. She buys fish from Mwanahamisi and sells her grocery
to her and also spends her sarafu to buy charcoal from Patricia.

Suleiman Mohammed (not pictured) where he sells Malimali (utensils and
other stuff) he depends on that business to put food on the table he is
delighted to be a member of sarafu since he can get his basic needs. He
buys Fish from Mwanahamisi and she in turn buys utensils from him.

SARAFU CHANGING LIVES! Imagine being evicted from your house because of
an accumulated rent arrears together with your 5 children. This is the
sad story of Fatuma Mzee, a 35 year old residing in Mjambere, Kisauni,
Mombasa Kenya of Sarafu.

_"My husband lost his work in 2016 and that pushed us to the toughest
experiences ever in our lives. We struggled through different casual
works just to put up with the bills-rent, fees,food,water and
electricity. Life became even harder when our landlord could not
tolerate us anymore, who would put up with 6 months arrears anyway? We
were evicted!_ _My family decided to look for a smaller house. It is
then that we moved to Mjambere. I have been here for 7 months. I started
my Juice, Ice and Ice Cubes business. Through Sarafu I was able to
provide at least one meal a day for my family._ _In mid February 2021, I
was lucky and overjoyed to know about Sarafu as it was introduced to my
community. Through Sarafu, I have been able to unite with my neighbors,
I've gained trust with them and this has enabled me to form my network
of trade. I can easily get my basic needs from my network and the sales
in my business have also increased. I'm grateful to Sarafu and I'm
looking forward to referring more people to Sarafu so that I can grow my
network." Fatuma narrated._

Among the users in Fatuma's network are:

- Ezline Chepkemboi: Ezline sells locally made detergents-jik,liquid
  soap and washing powders. Fatuma is no longer worried about her
  laundry since Ezline has her sorted. Ezline is also glad that she
  can get cold drinking water from Fatuma whenever the sun gets
  unbearably hot.
- Celly Jerotich: who just joined Fatuma's network is so excited about
  the concept. A widow and a mother to 2 adorable daughters runs her
  grocery shop just adjacent to Fatuma's place. Fatuma therefore has
  her grocery needs sorted and Celly is also glad to be receiving
  juice and detergents from Ezline and Fatuma.
- Rose Karimi: runs a small shop where she sells
  flour,rice,sugar,salt,cooking oil among other products. Talking to
  her about Sarafu,she was optimistic and happy that it was introduced
  to them. She stated that Sarafu has made it easier for them to get
  their basic needs. Karimi being in Fatuma's network, is sure of
  getting products from other small vendors around her as she also
  allows them to buy from her in Sarafu.
- Linet Saru: is a new addition to Fatuma's network. A single mother
  of two narrated that Sarafu will help her cub poverty as she feels
  more empowered to grow her local economy through her network. Linet
  is a fish vendor and she's glad to have joined Fatuma's network
  since they will all gain from one another using Sarafu.

I find it amazing how community inclusion currency (Sarafu) can support
and sustain the long-term resilience of the marginalized communities
like Mjambere! The initiative delivered to Kisauni by Kenya Red Cross
Society,Danish Red Cross and Grassroots Economics Foundation has
impacted Kisauni residence in a positive way as it has not only
strengthened and supported the vulnerable households but also created
unity within the community.

Mjambere is a community within Kisauni sublocation whose population
includes people from the grassroots. When the pandemic struck most
people from the community were already struggling to put food on the
table. This is an example of vulnerable communities which live from hand
to mouth.

Most people from this community are small business people who own small
shops, Grocery kiosk, fishermen, food vending, casuals etc. Due to lack
of consistency flow on Kenya shillings, some people struggle to get sell
their goods, find work or get basic needs and hence end up being in
debts. Covid-19 pandemic has made lives incredibly difficult all over
the world with dwellers of Mjambere in Kisauni being no exception.

Execution of Sarafu network by Grassroots economy in conjunction with
Kenya Red Cross in Kisauni community for the first time has been well
received- it being a tool for trading where Kenyan shillings is
lacking/not enough. Through Monthly statistics,its evident that sarafu
has been circulating among users in transacting goods and services which
has so far is creating a healthy and sustainable community in the face
of economic crisis.

Below are examples of success stories from a group of users who form a
good trading loop amongst themselves;

Mathew Musyoka a resident of Mjambere community is a middle aged man who
runs a Chemist .

With the surge of Covid 19, Musyoka has been willing to accept Sarafu
for Surgical Masks from the community as a way of preventing the spread
of Covid-19 and to help people save Ksh for other amenities. His daily
limit on how much Sarafu he will accept for Masks is unlimited since he
will still have some more stock even after selling some with KSH and
made enough profit to enable him restock. This is his corporate social
responsibility for his community. He also accepts Sarafu for over the
counter medicines.

Mathew has also benefited by buying goods from other vendors like Esther
Mutua who sells ground nuts and baked potatoes commonly knows as Viazi
Karai.

Christine is a food vendor from Mathew's network and whose son at one
point got sick and She was able to get some OTC medicine from Mathew's
chemist. Christine on the other hand is supporting the community by
accepting Sarafu for her chapati.

Abdallah's family comprises of seven members and their source of income
solely depends on daily sales from their family grocery kiosk. He is
greatful with the introduction of community currency now that he can
meet other basic needs for the family while using his trade networks
among Christine and Mathew.

Zaiwabu Moraa a grocer lady located a few meters from Mathew's chemist
is also connected to this active network and has supported her network
by accepting sarafu for groceries and fries.

Luvuno Kiti a fish monger is also been connecting with Zaiwabu trading
fish to groceries using sarafu this two are immediate neighbors. She has
been happy to accept 50 sarafu on a daily basis from other users and
later spend to to buy groceries from Zaiwabu and Mahamri (triangle
bread) from her other neighbor who operates a hotel.

These small businesses are good examples of how people build trust
amongst themselves, help others in the community while using a form of
local credit (Community Inclusion Currency) to grow their economy and
meet their basic need. Community based currency traders from this
village have been successful in meeting their daily needs as well as
getting more customers .

Kwekwe can now feed her family and take part in communal activities post
Red Cross Cash Transfer Programming even when there are little Kenyan
Shillings and ongoing insecure conditions.
