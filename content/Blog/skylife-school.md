Grassroots Economics works with communities across Kenya to develop
systems that allow parents to pay for their children's education using
their goods and services and when money is scarce. Community group
develop cooperative businesses, who's vouchers act as a medium of
exchange in the community. These vouchers (which we call Community
Currency) provide for stable trade even when national currency drains
out of the region due to slow months (external market volatility).
Parents can get a small school credit by accepting Community Currency in
their business. Parents and students can also take part in community
service work, like tree planting and elderly care for Community
Currency.

The Skylife school is located in Gatina 56 Kawangware, Nairobi. It is
one the most active schools in the Gatina network. The head teacher Mrs.
Susan Lukobo is one of the most active members since the community
currency commenced in Gatina the year 2014. The school has employed 9
teaching staff members and one being a non-teaching staff, with more
than 300 students attending. The school being an active user of
community currency has enabled students to acquire education without
hustles. Children with different backgrounds and up-bringing from the
surrounding area have been able to increase their attendance. Using
community currency for their tuition fees has made it possible for them
to acquire more knowledge and skills.

Once the school accepts it, community currency is used for paying
teachers as part of their monthly salaries in advance and the teachers,
in exchange, use it to purchase goods and services from hundreds of
other members registered or operating within the business network.
Members of the network (GBO) who have children attending schools like
Skylife have had an opportunity and an added advantage to involve their
children in the education program by using community currency to pay
school fees.

It has increased the number of students in schools compared to the
previous year by over 20%. Children with disabilities have also been in
a position to have equal chances compared to the normal students taking
studies in the same school. Community currency has promoted education in
the existing communities around Gatina Kawangware and this in turn has
increased trade in the community.
