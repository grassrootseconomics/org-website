As we close out another year at Grassroots Economics, I'm filled with gratitude and hope for the future. This year has been a testament to our collective strength and the power of mutual aid. We've brought back 1,637 traditional mutual aid "Mwerya" events that had vanished across Kenya where grassroots communities built 30 new houses, and established 139 farms, including 50 using Syntropic Agroforestry. Our protocols, and trainings have expanded to over 100 communities and several new countries, each a beacon of resilience.

Looking ahead, I'm excited to see us continue to blend indigenous wisdom with modern technology. We're not just building homes and farms; we're nurturing communities and restoring our bond with the earth. Every voucher created on sarafu.network is a step towards a more connected and sustainable world.

Let's keep this momentum going. Together, we can create a world where everyone has the freedom to contribute and thrive. Here's to a future filled with unity, compassion, and endless possibilities.

Join us in this journey at sarafu.network. Let's make 2024 even more impactful!

Follow the infographic above for the steps:

1. Make a voucher - it's free and is an expression of your intention. 
2. Combine vouchers with others: come together and organize a swap meet. (Think scion exchange)
3. Exchange what you have for what you want.
4. Enjoy fullfilling your commitments.
5. Divide up any profits or losses and start again. 

See if you can build a house like this group of village elders at [Kaya Chilumani](https://grassecon.org/kaya-chiman)!
