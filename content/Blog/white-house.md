on Wednesday as a finalist in the WomensConnect USAID program_

Our aim is to empower women to take charge of their economic future
through the creation of community currencies.

Grassroots Economics seeks to provide stable markets to Women's groups
in Kenya through women owned and operated community currency systems,
which will connect thousands of female small scale business traders in
rural and peri-urban areas, backstopped by a solar and mobile
technology.

By and large the promise of a better future for women through the
technological revolution has been mere hype at best, with a few
exceptions. Women are prevented from accessing and utilizing the
technologies available in their communities due to; environmental
barriers such as lack of access to electricity, lack of money to
purchase internet bundles, a lack of personal and/or community ownership
of infrastructure, and insufficient leadership for appropriate
implementation of digital systems. The growth of the mobile industry has
been led and driven by the spending power of men, in particular general
relational needs to communicate and socialize, not as an educational or
empowerment tool.

This revolutionary program will be piloted in partnership with Bancor
Foundation; to create community based digital currencies with trading
credit offered for all women's group members. This will be the starting
point for duplicating this program throughout East Africa and beyond.
The open source model, software, and training will be translated into
different languages for distribution throughout the developing world
where women share the same challenges. Each community can select its own
information and applications to be hosted on the walled garden server so
every woman has the potential to access the education she needs in her
context free of charge, along with the digital currency to make trades.
