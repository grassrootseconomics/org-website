With our program objectives, a basic income of SARAFU curbs some of the gaps that are facing. Often our members fall into debt - but when members use Sarafu this helps even in membership monthly contribution, and our group can also offer training to the community for Sarafu. If enough of us refugees trade with each other we don't suffer from missing Kenyan Shillings and debts. I can decide to buy food for my family using Sarafu to fill the gap of missing Shillings - and I can accept the Sarafu back for my teaching or food from my garden - even when we have no SHILLINGS! We all work together as a community.



We kindly request for support from Red Cross and other Humanitarian organizations in helping us spread Sarafu training to the rest of Kakuma to improve and give hope to the refugee community.



best regards



F.H.E CEO MARCELIN MUNGA PETRO
