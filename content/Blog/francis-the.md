Since several generations the family of Francis has been living in the
same neighborhood of Nairobi, Gatina (Part of Kwangware). Gatina, which
means in Kikuyu "people that are behind", is one of the biggest slums of
the city. Basic public utilities, such as electricity, roads and
sanitation are here deficient. For a living people are doing precarious
daily jobs or when they have the opportunity they start their own
informal business on the side of the road. That is what did Francis,5
years ago. At the age of 25, not having enough money to go to university
he started selling sweets. After years of efforts, he was finally able
to open a little shop and called it, as the bill board on its roof says,
"Millionaire base". Since then, to answer his basic needs and the ones
of his wife and daughter, Francis works from 6am to 9pm, 7 days a week.
But the business isn't good all year through. When comes the end of the
months, Kenyan Shillings become scarce and trade decreases. Moreover,
during the rainy season, because of the poor water draining system,
floods are more than common and trade becomes nearly impossible.

After hearing of the Bangla-Pesa program Nyendo-lernen, a German NGO
that works with schools in Kawangware, invited us to introduce the
concept to the Gatina community. When Francis first heard about the
success of Bangla-Pesa in Mombasa and the project of bringing it to
Gatina, he was convinced and took part in the introduction of the idea
to the community. Few months later we, together with the community,
started the program. Gatina-Pesa was launched and Francis became the
vice chairman and member of the Gatina Business Organization as did
nearly 100 other businesses, schools and churches within the area. Every
day, a part of his trade with the other members of the network happens
through Gatina-Pesa. The members can now buy his products, even when
they don't have enough Kenyan Shilling by topping up with Gatina-Pesa.
As a result, his number of costumers and daily revenue increased. The
same happened with the costumers belonging to the network. Indeed, as he
put it "You buy in my shop, I buy in your shop". According to him, this
daily interaction with the members also made his shop famous among the
community.

Every day, he usually receives 200 Gatina-Pesa (2$) from the members.
But at the end of the months, when the Kenyan shillings are becoming
scarce, the part of trade in Gatina Pesa increases and Francis get as
much as 300 Gatina-Pesa a day.

This amount is spent daily to answer 2/3 of his family needs in food,
water, paraffin, charcoal and medicine. Additionally, when comes the
time to pay his daughter school fees he can also pay a part in
Gatina-Pesa, the school being a member of the network.

As a result, the 200 Kenyan shillings that he would have otherwise been
spent are saved in the common saving account of the Gatina Business
Organization. In few months he hopes that through this program, he will
be able to get a loan and to expand his business. Indeed he wishes in
the long term to grow from his small shop to a supermarket and to a
wholesaler. Additionally, Gatina-Pesa can also help to manage the lack
of cash for the change. Francis gives up to 100 Gatina-Pesa a day as
part of the change for his costumers, members and even non members if
they know how to spend it.

But according to him the Gatina business Organization is also beneficial
as a network in itself. As Francis says : "The first thing it does, it
brings us together because in our network, we have the Kikuyus, we have
the Hindus, we have the Luos, we have many tribes, and when we come up
together we create this unity, this union, and when you walk as one, I
believe you can achieve a lot. As the saying goes, divided we fall,
together we rise".

Francis is part of a big family that is expanding every day. Other
businesses of Nairobi have decided to implement community currencies in
their area too. Grassroots Economics has also brought a community
currency to Kangemi (a neighboring informal settlement) and Kangemi-Pesa
has already been launched a month ago and Lindi-Pesa will soon too be in
Kibera. The three Complementary Currencies will be exchangeable among
them which we hope will multiply the positive benefits for their members
and will allow more families such as the one of Francis to be more
confident about their future.

Robin Gerbaux is studying International Development Studies as a
graduate student at the Université Joseph Fourier, in Grenoble, France.
He has been investigating community currencies while living in Nairobi.
