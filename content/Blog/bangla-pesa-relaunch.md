Bangla-Pesa was officially relaunched today in partnership with the
Kenyan Government. Represented by Hon. Badi Twalib Minister of
Parliament, Ward Representatives, the Speaker for the County Assembly,
Women's Representative, the Chief of Police (OCS) and the Mombasa
County Secretary. Other guests included Human Rights representatives
from Muhuri, the artist Carol Opondo and many others. There was a
unanimous request from government representatives to replicate these
programs to other areas in the County.

After waiting for 6 months since members of the program were arrested,
the community danced, sang, performed dramas and and recited poetry. The
team is extremely happy about the turn of events. On the Matatu home
from the event I was happy to overhear some women talking about the
program as a means of poverty reduction and it's complementary nature
to the Kenyan Shilling to create local stability. Traditional Peke
Dancing.Chief of Police (OCS) that once arrested us - now endorsing the
Bangla-Pesa.Registration for the program will being afresh next week.
Thanks for everyone's help making this event happen!
