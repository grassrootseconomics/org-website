Grassroots Economists are an integral part of building resilient local socioeconomic systems, utilizing and developing Community Asset Vouchers and Commitment Pooling to boost cultural economic activities to foster sustainable community wellbeing. Their work is grounded in Community Action Planning and Ecosystem Stewardship.

A Grassroots Economist understands that people are key to their own development. They are masters of the visionary approach, systems thinking and the principles of sustainable development. They guide communities to see and utilize their abundance among all their assets (social, human/spiritual, political, natural, physical, and economic). Formalizing community assets into Community Asset Vouchers enables Grassroots Economists to be paid for their work by the communities themselves.

4. Ensure you are deeply committed toward the visions of the people and groups you serve.
5. Value Your Work: Plan to receive payment for your services to people and groups.
   a. Develop a signed MoU with the community.

   c. Reciprocity is crucial for sustainable systems: Keep a balance between friendship and professionality.

**Core Activities**

1. Create Structural Tension to help people know what they want and develop shared action steps.
2. Facilitate and organize trainings on Community Asset Vouchers, Ecosystem Stewardship and Community Action Planning through the Visionary Process
3. Co-Organize: rotational and community services (ROLA), markets, jubilees and other activities.

**Deliverables**

2. Document community assets (baseline to current), vision, and status on their action plan.
3. Carry out an evaluation and prepare impact stories for each group to be presented at annual Jubilees and other stakeholder events.
4. Present these deliverables in order to renew your MoU with the community and  ensure they will continue paying for your services. Prove the impact of your own work. Did you give value for what you earned? 


**Remember (Tips)**

1. Be of service and don’t create dependency. Aim to be a trainer of trainers, support and develop community leadership.
2. Community Engagement: You can enable people but remember that people are key to their own development.
3. Digital Power: Use technology as a tool for transparency, learning, accounting, reporting and communications. Teach others.
4. Fair Access: Ensure everyone makes commitments toward their own resources and has a chance to access the group’s resources fairly.
5. Asset Mapping: Regularly review your own and groups Action Steps and identify and leverage the resources, including collaborations with schools, government, clinics and so on, to achieve goals.
6. Continuous Monitoring, Research and Learning: Seek out new ideas and information. Assess and adjust your vision and action steps as needed. Embrace new approaches to community wellbeing.
