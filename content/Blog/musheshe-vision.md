Inspired by Mwalimu Musheshe after a visit to his community in Uganda, I've remembered this week to not focus on problems or problem solving. Instead focus on and describe our vision - then the structural tension between the current situation and that vision.

In Kagadi Uganda I witnessed communities surrounded by lush green hills, plantains, cassava, and maize close to harvest. I could see clearly a vision of each community as a mountain of wealth, producing layer upon layer of food, soil, shelter, care, ideas, training, art, joy... now and for generations to come.

I could see these mountains of service, not in isolation, but in a vast mountain range all connected to each other.

In this vision communities are empowered to collectively measure and manifest the value of these etheric mountains of products and service provided by people and communities into the future√¢ all tapping into their abundance of vast expansive regenerative wealth. 

Trust in this value, denominated in teaching and farming hours, plantains, eggs, etc., rather than shillings, is witnessed and accredited by local stakeholders and recorded into a ledger so that credit can be shared. This shared trust is the basis for a caring economy for generations to come. And potentially implemented by the issuance and deployment of Community Inclusion Currencies.

The current reality is that people's value is only measured based on how much they can sell their daily services for denominated in national currency. This is extremely limited - rarely will anyone be given credit against their future production and communities have to struggle often against each other. Traditional markets have existed since before we had written history - since these traditional societies were forced to only use national currency to both value their services and trade - cash-poor community markets often stagnate.

The structural tension between our current reality and this vision, involves communities able to collectively value, record and certify their mountains of future service without dependency. 

Rather than only saving scarce national currency and being rejected by banks to receive credit, can a family with 1 acre of land and production and services they offer be accredited by their community as trust-worthy and develop a credit among their neighbors, local schools and clinics? 

**Yes they can.**

Moving from credit scarcity to locally created credit abundance is something we can all do if we can envision the potential of our vast mountain range of future offerings and create action plans to move from our current reality. 

In my vision this week, I see Grassroots Economics to deliver the technology which can make this happen by bringing Community Inclusion Currencies to the URDT and Uganda. We can also help to grow even more produce out of that rich Ugandan soil in even more productive, regenerative systems design.

For more information on Mwalimu Musheshe and Uganda Rural Development & Training visit [URDT](https://urdt.net/). We're grateful for [Mustardseed Trust](https://www.mustardseedtrust.org/) for bringing together this match made in heaven.

I'm really excited about further collaboration between Grassroots Economics and URDT in developing a shared vision toward community driven regenerative economics.
