## Empowering Communities through Faith: The Righteous Seed Church Groups of Kilifi

In the heart of Kilifi county, Kenya, two remarkable church groups, Righteous Seed Misufini and Mnarani, are weaving tales of unity, resilience, and faith. Both groups, though distinct in their journeys, share a common thread: their unwavering commitment to faith, community empowerment and the innovative use of Community Asset Vouchers.

**Strength in Unity and Tradition: Righteous Seed Misufini**

Nestled in the village of Misufini, 14 single mothers formed a bond that would forever change their lives. United by the shared goal of supporting one another and ensuring a brighter future for their families, they founded Righteous Seed Misufini. Through diverse activities like poultry farming, salon services, and vegetable trading, these women have not only uplifted their lives but also inspired their community.

Pooling their resources and talents, they've become a testament to the power of unity. Their innovative approach to community support reintroduced "mweria," a traditional practice of mutual aid. This practice, which involves rotational communal labor activities like wall thatching using locally available resources, not only honors their heritage and faith, but also strengthens their bonds.

**Faith and Unity in Action: Righteous Seed Mnarani**

In the buzy area of Kilifi Mnarani, a close-knit church group gathers every Friday evening, weaving a tapestry of faith and community. Beyond their spiritual connections, they've integrated acts of service into their ethos. As part of their fellowship, members offer their labor for tasks like gardening or household chores, reinforcing the idea that unity is built on shared responsibility.

**Community Asset Vouchers: Bridging Faith and Practical Support**

Both groups have embraced the concept of Community Asset Vouchers, albeit in slightly different ways. For the women of Misufini, these vouchers became a lifeline, supplementing the national currency and allowing them to invest more in their businesses and children's futures. They've also used these vouchers to trade services among themselves, further strengthening their community ties.

On the other hand, the Mnarani group has integrated these vouchers into their ethos of mutual support and fellowship. By offering their skills, goods, or services to one another, they've created a micro-economy of care and abundance, ensuring everyone's needs are met and talents are valued.
