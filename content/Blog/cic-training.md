As support to vulnerable communities humanitarian organizations start by
airdropping tokens to needy people in coordination with local
authorities and village groups and elders, and facilitating periodic buy
backs in Kenyan shillings (KSH) from those community groups. We also
reward people with tokens for referring others and based on trading in
network. The Sarafu token in Kenya is one such an aid-based Community
Inclusion Currency (CIC) which is meant to bootstrap the creation of
local CICs to be used toward recovery. Let's call such an bootstrapping
CIC (like Sarafu) 'CIC_a'.

An aid program in Kenya has developed 16 Million Sarafu tokens in Kenya
collateralize by 4 Million Kenyan Shillings ($40,000 USD) of a digital
asset (DAI). (Note that CIC_a is collateralized by being bonded to a
digital asset (DAI) using donor funds on a public blockchain -- which
can be extracted and used to create community based CIC, which we will
discuss below. )

In vulnerable communities across Kenya anyone joining the network
receives 400 Sarafu as well as additional Sarafu based on trade and
referrals. Community groups receive additional donor funds for a limited
amount of Sarafu (CIC_a) collected.

Note that using this technique alone in Kenya has produced more than 80
Million KSH ($800,000 USD) worth of trade in these communities so far.

**Recovery:**

The community group is
[trained](https://gitlab.com/grassrootseconomics/cic-docs/-/blob/master/README.md)
to use the digital assets bonded to CIC_a to create their own Community
Inclusion Currency (CIC). They come up with a name, (Let's call this new
CIC, 'CIC_b') a vision and goals as well as community projects to be
funded by their CIC_b. Note that there can be many community groups
creating their own CICs (CIC_c ... d ... e, etc) depending on the
scale of the CIC_a distribution. In Kenya the Sarafu distribution has
reached over 27,000 household in dozens of communities so we expect many
CICs to be created, while pulling out the digital assets from Sarafu.
(the Photo on the left show a community discussion on projects tehy
could fund with their own CIC)

The members of the community group pull the digital asset (valued in
Kenyan Shillings) out of their CIC_a (destroying CIC_a) and place it
into a new contract for CIC_b.

For each $1 Kenyan Shillings (KSH) (worth of digital assets pulled out
of their CIC_a) placed in the new CIC_b contract, 4 CIC_b's will be
created. (Note that we require a minimum amount of collateral and a
collateral to CIC_a ratio of 25% to start a CIC).

The community group then comes up with audited commitments to accept
their payment for goods and services for CIC_b with 1:1 value to Kenyan
shillings. They also develop rules for managing those commitments and
local arbitration. i.e. one community member will agree to accepting 100
CIC_b a day for 100 KSH worth of day care for toddlers.

For each 1 CIC_b created there must be a commitment from the groups
members to accepting 1 KSH worth of goods or services. Hence each CIC_b
is 100% backed by commitments of local goods and services.

Eg. So for 400,000 CIC_b created, there is full backing in commitments
by the community group as well as 100,000 KSH (~1,000 USD) worth of
collateral. Based on community discussion, generally half of these
400,000 CIC_b's go to the contributing members and the other half goes
to voted-on community projects managed by agreed on community project
managers. (the photo on the right shows Ruth Njau teaching trainers on
the usage of a hatch board, recording commitments).

The photo here shows Roy Awaho from Kenya Red Cross and comunity members
learning about Bonding Curves - which explains the diminishing returns
from pulling out of their collateral fund - explained below and more in
depth in our [training
materials](https://gitlab.com/grassrootseconomics/cic-docs/-/blob/master/README.md).

**Basic Usage:**

Now that members of the community group have created their own CIC
(CIC_b), they are now able to liquidate (cash out) their CIC_b against
the collateral fund and receive Kenyan Shillings (via Mpesa eMoney).
Each time they pull out of their collateral out it takes more CIC_b to
pull out the same amount. For instance 1004 CIC_b
(destroyed/liquidated) will pull out roughly 1000 KSH out of the
collateral. After that it will take 1012 CIC_b to pull out 1000 KSH.
After that it will take 1020 CIC_b to bull out 1000 KSH and so on.

This gives businesses some assurance that they can get Kenyan shillings
when needed. As the amount of CIC_b to pull out KSH increases -- there
is an opportunity to add KSH back into the collateral pool. 1000 KSH in
our last example added to the collateral would create 1020 CIC_b's and
as long as the community group is holding their commitments there is an
advantage to doing so -- in order to buy local products. This market
effect stabilizes the exchange value.

Impact investors and aid organizations can also support communities by
adding to the collateral pool and minting CIC_b's. Just by doing so
they increase the exchange value of CIC_b. This is like an investment
into the economy of CIC_b users. The CIC_b's created in the process
can be donated to needy community members as well.

Giving humanitarian organizations a way to respond to crisis and seed
resilient economies is at the heart of CICs. The end effect is that
communities have a way to create their own credit systems for supporting
themselves responsibly with both social and hard collateral.
