We've been working to replace the need for Mombasa's Bangladesh
residents to import food and conserve their environment. Two schools
near a mangrove forest have:

- begun stabilizing eroded soils by planting grasses and trees
- catching rainwater by installing gutters
- planting vegetables
- and conserving the mangrove forests to stabilize spawning locations
  for crabs

February has been a great month. The schools have worked hard at their
gardens and have tried to bring in water whenever it is needed even
though there was a shortage. Baby vegetable seedlings are starting to
sprout and the pioneer plants the lemon grass and bamboo are doing well.

PROGRESS REPORT FOR PERMACULTURE GARDENS IN ST. ANGELINE'S AND ST.PETER
AND PAUL

The setting up of permaculture gardens in the two schools had the
following main objectives for Grassroots Economics:

- Combat the severe soil erosion in the compounds
- Inculcate in the children a sense of social responsibility
- Boost the nutrition of the families by growing vegetables and fruit
  trees in the gardens
- Link the schools and the community through use of community currency

The objectives are being achieved gradually and the pupils have been
working hard at it. Albeit we have had a few challenges but we are on
course to set up within six months.

Combating Severe soil erosion. This objective is being achieved by:

- i. Setting up tree nurseries that will provide a sustainable way to
  continuously plant trees even after the targeted six months. The
  children have set a target of planting trees at least three
  times their age by the end of the year Tree nurseries have been
  set for indegenous trees like the Mrabai, Bambakofi and Luceana
  which will be great pioneer trees as they already grow in the
  surrounding villages along with the Flamboyant and neem trees.
  We taught the children to do seed harvesting so we hope to have
  an explosion of tree species of their choosing as they have fun
  planting.

- ii. Planting of pioneer trees and plants that will help in covering
  the ground and also combat soils erosion- this has been started
  off by the planting of Lemon grass and bamboo which are trees
  that have roots that can hold soil and are part of companion
  planting initiatives. The lemon grass can be used for pest
  control when planted around the vegetable gardens and will also
  prevent soil loss through erosion. Bamboo planted at the bottom
  of the slopes will hold water and also when planted at the top
  will help in cleaning grey water that will run into the kitchen
  gardens.

- iii. We also ensured to build swales- that will help in slowing
  water down as it runs down the slope and is a form of natural
  water harvesting technique.

Inculcating a sense of social responsibility in the children.This has
been achieved by:

- i. Holding weekly sensitization classes- for the pupils on the uses
  of trees and how it is their resposibility to leave the school
  better than it is.

- ii. We have also partnered with another organizations -- so that
  they can be trained on the benefits of mangroves and how to
  propagate them. They have also started setting up mangrove
  nurseries. The mangove will be planted at the beach near the
  school and it will be their way of giving to the community.

Boosting the Nutrition of the community by planting fruit trees and
vegetables. We started this off by ensuring the schools had:

- i. Tanks with gutters- that at the onset of rains they would be
  able to harvest rain that will in turn nourish the vegetables.

- ii. We also involved the community in digging of swales- that we
  filled up with manure and dry grass that we left for about for a
  month that would help in boosting the nutrition content of the
  severely eroded soils.

- iii. We had the children trained on setting up tree and vegetable
  nurseries- that they would plant in the swales, and the other
  small vegetable gardens. Vegetables that are in the seedbed are:
  Kales, bringles and spinach. We hope to introduce gradually
  tomatoes, water melons, pumkins and some traditional vegetables
  as we want them to have a stacked garden with creepers that act
  as cover crops to retain moisture and other vegetables that grow
  taller. As for food and fruit trees we will introduce the
  nitrogen fixing and nutrient enriching Moringa Oliefera whose
  leaves are medicinal and super rich in nutrients along with paws
  paws, bananas, grafted mangoes and oranges. We will also
  introduce sugar cane on areas that pool with water.

- iv. The schools have also been trained on companion planting- so
  that the know how to plant the vegetables and food trees to
  ensure maximum yield and using organic pest control methods.

So far each school has two kitchen gardens one that will be mostly
vegetables and a few food trees and one that will contain fruit trees
and vegetables

The schools as part of the Sarafu -- Credit community currency.

At the onset we had meetings with the schools with one of the
Bangla-Pesa representatives who would act as a link between the business
community and the school. The lady Sylvia Osodo will ensure that when
the community is involved in program is involved in the program
especially the youth the business network can pay part of the labor fees
in Sarafu-Credit from the community basket whenever the need for payment
arises.

We envision however the community will gradually take part especially
ones within the business network and once we harvest the vegetables we
could have the business community buy in part Kenya Shillings and
Sarafu-Credit and at a subsidized rate than they would get at the Market
and have the schools in turn purchase goods or services from the
Business community on normal days and especially during market days.
