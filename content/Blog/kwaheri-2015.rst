Five Community Currency (CC) trading business networks in Kenya have started their end of the year activities, using collected membership dues in CC as a community fund to care for the needy. A lot has happened this year. With only ~2,000 Euros worth of CC in circulation between five networks, we're seeing as much as 350 Euros of daily trade. This makes a huge impact on the lives of small businesses and schools in informal settlements.




Trade Volume



 

* Amount in circulation: 216,000 Kenyan Shillings (1,911 EUR)
* Daily Circulation estimate in November. 39,430 Kenyan Shillings. This is 18% of total in circulation traded daily. (358 EUR)* This is a low estimate for average yearly as we approach holiday seasons.
* Monthly Circulation: ~1,118,000 Kenyan Shillings (10,750 EUR)
* Yearly Circulation: ~14,000,000 Kenyan Shillings (129,000 EUR) This as new trade within five low income informal settlements.


The amount of trade is more than 200% higher than the amount of funding it has taken to setup these programs and will continue to grow.
