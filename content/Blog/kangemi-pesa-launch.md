Kangemi-Pesa is launching on April 4th 2015! After six months of
preparation the Kangemi Businessness Network has reached over 100
members-including small shops, tailors, teachers, suppliers, resalers,
restaurants and much more. Each member on the launch day will be
allotted 400 Kangemi-Pesa of which 200 goes toward a community fund to
pay for trash collection and other community efforts. The Kangemi-Pesa
is backed by the goods and services of the community.

Along with Bangla-Pesa, first launched in 2013 and Gatina-Pesa launched
in 2014, Kangemi-Pesa is the third of what will be six community
currencies trading in Kenya by the end of this year. Kangemi-Pesa's
introduction and launch was suported by Lush Cosmetic. Neighboring
Gatina-Pesa in Kawangware will be tradable with Kangemi-Pesa. These
business networks form the core of a decentralized banking system for
Nairobi County. Coming soon are currencies in Kibera as well as two more
in Mombasa County. We are also excited to be supporting the
implementation of programs in South Africa and are looking forward to a
community currency being launched there in May!

Experiences from Community Currency users remind us of why these
programs are important. John Wacharia has a small Kinyozi (Barber shop),
and when there was a system wide power outage for three days, he told
us, "Bangla-Pesa allowed me to provide for my family, eat and survive
when I could no longer work". These programs form a buffer system
against unstable markets by allowing people to trade their goods and
services even when they don't have Kenyan shillings. So far each one of
these currency programs creates an additional 3 million shillings of
trade each year. Networked together, hundreds of these programs could
increase the GDP by more than a Billion dollars.
