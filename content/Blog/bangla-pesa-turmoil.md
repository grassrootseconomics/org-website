The Bangla-Pesa, a complementary currency created and backed by a local
business network, offers a glimpse of true sustainable development.
After only a week of circulation, Bangla-Pesa was able to help community
members tap into an estimated 22% increase in their sales through
excess-capacity trading. This is a substantial increase in a community
of people living in extreme poverty. We hope to see this program
continue to benefit the people of Bangladesh, who have devoted their
efforts in its formation.

A network of mico-enterprises coming together to co-own and create their
own complementary currency could be considered the next step bringing
together cooperatives and micro-finance. While positive results in a
short time make complementary currencies like Bangla-Pesa an appealing
sustainable development solution in poverty-stricken areas, we also have
an immediate need for international support to promote legislation and
understanding at national and central banking levels.

Sadly, because of a misunderstanding by local authorities, community
members Alfred Sigo, Emma Onyango, Rose Oloo, Paul Omolo, Carolin Dama
and Will Ruddick were jailed on suspicion that they were part of a
secessionist terrorist group (nothing could be farther from the truth).
After this was found to not be the case, and seeing no other reason to
keep them in jail, the group of six (including two mothers, a
grandmother, and a grandfather) were charged by the Central Bank of
Kenya, with forgery for holding a printed voucher. This charge is
baseless, and they in fact have a printing receipt from Kenya's top
printer (Punchlines Ltd.). They are now out of jail on bail and awaiting
trial.

Since this disruptive reaction from local authorities, there has been an
outpouring of support. Please keep it coming! Without it, this matter
could get stuck in court for years and deny Bangladesh businesses a tool
that business networks worldwide use.

Thanks so much to all our supporters! And we hope very much that the
community of Bangladesh continues to be supported. [Click here if you
