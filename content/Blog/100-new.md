Rural communities are adopting blockchain based community currencies at
an astounding pace! 100+ new users in one day represents nearly half the
heads of households in one village. Women are the main users and have
been leading their communities in using the blockchain as much as 4
times a day for their basic needs -- water, food, school and fuel. With
nearly 2,000 blockchain wallets created in underserved communities so
far in Kenya and over 11,000 transactions using feature phones with no
internet - the excitement is tangible. **Something very fundamental
about these economies is starting to change.**

The Miyani community, categorized as food insecure for over 10 years has
had every development intervention thrown at it by dozens of NGOs
including WFP and Red Cross. A group of farmers in Miyani began
developing methodology and using Community Currencies in late 2018 and
have grown their network to cover their entire village (showing
tremendous change to food consumption and collective work for food
security) and have spread into all their neighboring villages.

So far 2 new Community Currencies have started in the nearby regional
markets of Mnyenzeni and Mkayeni and as more and more communities adopt
these currencies local groups will be able to create their own --
creating a decentralized economic network. This is enabling people to
trade their goods and services even when there is no National Currency.
Farmers are able to get community support for preparing their lands for
rains and women are able to send their kids to school and support one
another without scarce Kenyan Shillings.

In the past, traditional aid organizations and development programs have
failed to address the fundamental problems plaguing the economic
infrastructure of marginalized communities across the world. Pumping
typical aid into these economies often exacerbates unsustainable food
systems and market dynamics by reinforcing the existing economic
structure. The bulk of the aid flows out of the community too quickly to
provide lasting impact and key resources & community members remain
largely underutilized.

These communities have developed a scalable solution based on blockchain
enabled community currencies which has been shown to incentivize
resilient local markets and promote regional food security. **We are
proud to be part of this story and are excited to see where these
indigenous solutions lead us!**
