Summary: The reserve behind these tokens, the actual aid funding, was about $2.5k USD).This means that $2,500 USD of Aid funds created 10,000 tokens

This is one of 6 locations around Kenya using Community Inclusion
Currencies (CICs). Here you can see the trading between the 1,877
most-active users in the Mnyenzeni area of Kwale, Kenya (a chronically
food-insecure area) over the last 2 months -- November and December 2019. Their total amount of trade together was 5,476,805 tokens locally
worth about $50,000 USD. To put this in context: Each user represents a
family of ~5 living on ~50 USD a month -- while they continue to spend
that 50 USD they are now spending an additional 30 USD of CICs. Hence
CIC spending could average around 38% of their spending -- this is an
increase of 1.6 times their consumption. That is roughly 1.6 times the
children going to school regularly, 1.6 more meals being eaten and so
on.

Rather than simply give out national currency as in typical aid programs
the idea here is to seed the reserves of Community Inclusion Currencies
(CICs). The CICs leverage their reserve into 4x the amount of local
credit available. CIC are essentially shares of both underlying reserves
as well as social capital (community acceptance). People can use them to
pull out the national currency in reserve over time or trade them with
each other -- acting as a medium of exchange when national currency is
scarce.

This $50,000 USD of trade acts as a sustainable buffer system that is
resilient to shocks that cause National Currency to vanish and stall
markets. It is filling a gap left by a lack of medium of exchange. The
50,000 USD of trade shown here was done using roughly 10,000 tokens
(CICs) each given an initial local value of about $1 USD. The reserve
behind these tokens, the actual aid funding, was about $2.5k USD).

This means that $2,500 USD of Aid funds created 10,000 tokens (CICs)
which were treated as shares and given a value of $10,000 USD -- which
was used to facilitate $50,000 USD of trade -- this is an impact
multiplier of 20x!

What is exciting about CICs is that any community could decide to take
some capital and treat it as a commons and leverage it into a local
credit system -- and integrate with other credit systems. Those 1,877
users above are using 3 distinct Community Inclusion Currencies backed
by different groups of businesses and their own reserves.

**So how did these 3 currencies get started in the Mnyenzeni area of
Kenya?** Reserves in Kenyan Shillings were added by donors and the CICs
were minted based on that collateral. The Chief, elders, and women's
groups all came together for training from other communities already
using CICs and began using a feature phone-based (button phone = no need
for internet or smart phone) platform to trade with each other, each
having received an air-drop of 400 CICs (worth about $4 USD). Here in
Kenya the injection of seed capital from Humanitarian Aid into the
reserves of these systems is the jump start (bootstrap) that gets
everyone involved and builds trust in the system. Most importantly the
marketplace starts with a few groups (mostly savings and loan women's
groups) and foundational businesses or cooperatives that agree to
accepting CICs. They give users a reason to continually refill the
reserve and increase the value of the CICs.

What most excites me about 2020 is that these tools are being piloted
and made available on an [open source
platform](http://github.com/teamsempo) platform and could be available
via Red Cross worldwide in the next few years. This means a lot for
humanitarian aid, for poverty and for humanity.
