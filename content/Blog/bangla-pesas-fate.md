We are still being charged with forgery under penal code 367(e). For
Kenyan Laws see [page
121](http://www.kenyalaw.org/klr/fileadmin/pdfdownloads/Acts/PenalCodeCap63.pdf).

On July 15th - the Kenyan Dirctor of Public Prosecutions, [Keriako
Tobiko](http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/government/attoneyG.htm)
recalled our case file and hence the trial was not allowed to proceed.

Apparently this was due to a large amount of interest in the case and a
recent [petition](http://grassrootseconomics.org/petition) . More in the
[news](http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/DPP-recalls-case-against-Bangla-Pesa-informal-currency/-/539546/1917800/-/949nai/-/index.html)

So we are currently praying for a positive verdict from Keriako Tobiko
so that these programs can continue.
