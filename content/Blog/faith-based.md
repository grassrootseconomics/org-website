Due to economic instability, many people in the marginalized communities
are short of money to pay for church offerings or even worse, to set up
their local churches. Local churches that have begun to develop their
own community currencies (Sarafu) in order to developed their church
structures and pay offerings and even meet their basic needs. Sarafu has
created a stable medium of exchange allowing them to support one another
as individuals and also their church at large. Below are some of the
examples:

# AMK CHURCH

The church (pictured above) is located in Mkanyeni village, Mtaa
location, Bofu Sub-location in Kasemeni ward, Kwale County. It was
started way back in 1990. The church was founded by Pastor Dzeha Nyanje
as the community did not have any place of worship around by then. Being
that they could not afford the construction money, the congregation
resorted to worshiping under a tree every Sunday. In the year 2000,
through the leadership of Pastor Dzeha Nyanje,the church decided to put
up a temporary structure using mud.

"The tree that provided us with the shade dried up and fell down and
that's when we decided to build a temporary structure" Dzeha explains.

At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Mkanyeni community was
among the numerous communities that were empowered by Sarafu to build
their own prospering economies. Pastor Dzeha Nyanye was one of the
people that was trained on how to use the Community Inclusion Currency
-a blockchain based voucher used to trade among community members when
the national currency is scarce. Dzeha who is also a shopkeeper explains
how Sarafu has impacted his community positively,

_"Sarafu has been a safe way of trade even during the pandemic since I
no longer need to carry cash, it has also created job opportunities in
my community since the youths and even those without businesses or jobs
can now offer services to those registered in Sarafu and earn an income.
My sales have also increased as the users that could not have afforded a
product from my shop due to lack of the national currency, can now use
Sarafu to top up the little they have and get a product from me. I have
created a network in my community and I'm also able to get other
products that I don't have in my shop from other users in my network."_

It is during this time that Dzeha saw an opportunity to develop his
church. He quickly shared this concept with his congregation and they
equally liked and received the concept well. They were happy and
optimistic about building their church through Sarafu. They contributed
Sarafu jointly and bought the building materials like sand, cement.
metals, water and stones. They were able to pay the people that would
work on the site in Sarafu and those people with Sarafu could pay
tithings and local goods and services from the congregation. Their
church is not yet done but they are grateful that Sarafu was introduced
in their community. They are hoping to complete their roofing soon. _"We
are grateful to Sarafu because through it, my community got empowered
and as a church in particular, we've made tremendous developments."_
Said Elizabeth Chari, one of the church members.

AMK church's new permanent construction.

A congregation that consists of 48 members are now able to worship in a
conducive environment. They are glad that they can now easily give in
their church offerings every Sunday using Sarafu as this was initially a
challenge since the national currency was scarce. Being that they
worship together, they've formed a sustainable economy and network where
they support each other by exchanging goods and services using Sarafu
during their normal days. They are therefore growing their local economy
as well as receiving basic needs like food, water, transportation among
other needs.

# ST. REGINA SEGERE LEGIO MARIA

The church is located in Ouru village, Alego Usonga Constituency in
Siaya County. The church was started in 1973. The church has a
congregation of around 50 members pictured above. Apart from worshiping
and praying together, they support the youths, orphans, widows, the
physically challenged and the mentally challenged persons within their
community. They've been using part of their tithes and offerings to run
this course. They've also been mobilizing well wishers to attend
harambes (community support offerings) after which they would use the
funds raised to cater for the needs of the school going orphans under
their custody.

When Emmaculate Onyango, one of the founders of Bangla-Pesa visited the
church and enlightened them on the importance of the Community Inclusion
Currencies (CICs), the church embraced the concept and created time for
training. They grasped every aspect of how it works and 40 of them were
then registered to the system. This group has been able to play a major
role in their community as they've also registered other members within
their local markets hence creating a big sustainable network of trade.

Sarafu.

They were lucky enough to also get empowered and trained on Syntropic
Agroforestry through the Shamba ya Jamii program -a regenerative
agriculture technique that provides a long term food forests. They've
then started up their farm that they run and maintain using Sarafu.
They've been able to source for local farm inputs and seeds and also pay
labourers who work on their farms daily using Sarafu. Their farm is
doing well and they are hopeful that in two weeks time, they will have
their first harvest of vegetables.

Speaking to Christabell- a selfless hardworking lady in her mid
twenties, she gladly explains how great Sarafu has improved their
livelihood, _"It was hard feeding the big number of the vulnerable
persons that we have under our care since the offerings that we use for
the same weren't enough or rather sustainable. Since we started using
Sarafu, the burden is lighter. We are able to source food from the
nearby market since we also registered them in Sarafu. The youths are
also empowered and can now offer services to different users and get
paid in Sarafu. We receive more offerings than before and we use the
same to cater for basic needs. We are also working hard in our farms and
we are looking forward to good harvest that we will also sell in
Sarafu"_

# Pastors Network Nairobi

This is a group of around 36 members from different denominations within
the 30 counties out of the 47 counties in Kenya who came up with a
vision to develop local churches, teach the good news, support the
vulnerable persons in their community and reach out to the elderly
within their communities. They usually contribute from their pockets to
run their course. They have been experiencing financial challenges as
sometimes they also lack the money to give into the kitty.

When Sarafu was introduced to their community, they felt that the
concept would help them fill the gaps in their quest to support the
vulnerable households in their different communities. They were trained
on how to use the Community Inclusion Currencies(CIC) after which they
were registered. They joined the many other communities that have been
empowered to prosper their own economies. They were able to get basic
needs through exchanging goods and services in Sarafu. The pastor
Network Group joined hands and registered all the people under their
course. _"Since we started using Sarafu, I have never slept hungry as I
can easily get food from my network. Before Sarafu, I could only manage
to get one meal a day. I'm looking forward to making my network bigger
to help me get more products. We also use Sarafu in our churches to pay
tithes and offerings."_ Said Mary, the group's treasurer. Members of
Pastors Network (pictured above) group ready to visit a number of
vulnerable households.

The vulnerable people that they take care of have since been able to buy
food, water and pay for their transportation using Sarafu. The burden is
now lighter to the group as they only provide other needs like education
and medical needs to them. They are planning to start up projects -bee
keeping and farming that they will run and maintain using Sarafu. The
main goal of the projects is to get more funds to help the vulnerable
people and to create job opportunities within their communities.

We continue to drum up the importance of communities building their own
economies through using the Community Inclusion Currencies that would
hence enable them to exchange goods and services and maintain and run
projects and businesses without waiting on the national currency that is
mostly scarce especially in the marginalized communities. The churches
are therefore not left behind as they are enabled to run their
activities and support different peoples under their care through the
use of Sarafu.
