Grassroots Economics Foundation has been at the forefront of empowering
bottom-of-the-pyramid communities in Kenya by use of Sarafu Network; a
network of Community Currencies, (CCs), operating in Nairobi and Mombasa
respectively.

It started with 75 businesses in Kongowea (Mombasa) launching Eco Pesa
as the first local currency in 2010, then Bangla-Pesa in
Mikindani-Mombasa-Kenya, which the locals embraced. To-date, community
members have been using it as a Community Currency to pay for goods and
services enriching their daily lives.

a strategic planning session._

This project, which started with an aim to reduce economic instability
in marginalize communities has seen people and businesses increase local
trade by providing a complementary means of payment where the national
currency is scarce. This reduces debts as CCs become a spending currency
while the Kenyan shilling, becomes a tool for saving. In Nairobi, more
than 1000 small businesses take an active role in their own economic
development in this way. This has led to a 17% increase in local jobs
creation and 37% growth in sales revenue through the frequent
transactions that happen in these [Sarafu-Credit
locales.](http://www.grassrootseconomics.org/community-currencies).

The good news about this is that Sarafu-Credit users in these
communities, no longer depend on their income or wages as the only way
to cater for their daily needs. They can now depend on each other and
use local currencies to buy food like fruits, vegetables, snacks and
access services like tailoring, hairdressing and getting rid of waste
materials dumped within the community.

Community Currencies in the Sarafu Network like Gatina Pesa in
Kawangware connect underutilized work forces with unused resources to
create local industries that guarantee the provision of basic needs.

So, how do people in the Network use

Sarafu-Credit users get to access goods and services from sellers who
accept the CCs, creating a network of traders who unite the different
areas and hence uplifting the economy of that community.

Besides, traders using Sarafu-Credit as an alternative economic system
and supplementing the inadequate national currency, they are also
achieving SDGs goals themselves in vulnerable communities. For example,
Sarafu has a direct impact on; food security, decent work, sustainable
communities and economic growth.

**Design and cultural symbolism of community currency.**

Sarafu-Credit is created using cryptocurrencies and also is printed on
high-quality paper with designs and symbolic representations depicting
the cultural values of the community. This leaves no room for
counterfeiting. Participants involved accept and agree on this form of
exchange, creating a connected and liquid market for all the Community
Currencies in these regions.

What to note is, the implementation of CCs system in Kenya, is an
innovative way of improve living standards, as it also protects and
advances Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

SDG's can be tied to community currencies, whereby for instance, farmers
could be linked directly with urban consumers by using a local currency,
enhancing food security.

Community events like the one in the photo below in Nairobi and Mombasa
target community members who are new to the concept of community
currencies and the longtime users who will be recognized for their
knowledge/progress as Sarafu-Credit users and ability to take charge of
their lives.

This is an open day dedicated to community sharing, networking,
educating and training on how the CCs work, as well as coming together
to implement new ways that their own Community Currency will improve
their communities.
