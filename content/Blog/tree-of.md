Since beginning in the field of "development" over 10 years ago every
time I visit a new community I find there is a lack of understanding
between the concepts of aid and development. To describe the
differences, I borrowed a chart from the famous book "Where There Is No
Doctor" by Hesperian Press. The chart is intended to detail two types of
healthcare, but can be applied generally to any intervention or program
intended to serve the poor, including income generation. The tree and
the field represent the "Land of Knowledge". This heavenly land is where
all the people who have had the opportunity for education and social
mobility live. It is the realm of doctors and nurses, but also of
economists, scholars, and professional aid workers. These people who
have been able to make educational advancement have two choices for
interacting with the people who have been trapped in what we call "the
pit of ignorance". Those trapped in the pit of ignorance have had
limited opportunities for education and advancement typically due to the
cyclical nature of extreme poverty.

On one side of the image we show a doctor throwing medicines into the
pit with little concern as to how or if the fellow in the pit ever sees
the light of day. This shows the aid approach which believes when
someone has a need, it is suitable to meet that need temporarily and
immediately without concerns of bringing someone out of the pit, but
keeps them alive. Aid is like putting a bandaid to a gaping wound and
expecting it to stop bleeding. It creates dependency and a loss of
freedom. The person in the pit needs someone from the land of knowledge
to come and save them in order survive. The person in the pit grows
accustomed to his depency so spends the rest of their live languishing
and waiting for handouts.

On the other side of the image, we show a man from the land of knowledge
offer a rope to the person in the pit so they can now begin to climb out
and feel the sunshine in the land of knowledge. This side shows
sustainable development. It is not a quick fix or temporary approach but
one that prioritizes the long term impact of working with the
disadvantaged and removing their barriers to a level playing field.
Helping others to learn to care for themselves encourages self reliance
and equity.

The difference between these two approaches can be clearly illustrated
through Grassroots Economics community currency programs. If the
organization decided people need money and sent a one time cash
transfer, that transfer would last a few days before perhaps even weeks
before the individual will ask for another transfer. That would be an
aid driven model which would be discontinued at the end of the program,
leaving the individual in a similar position to where she began. The
program may have saved her temporarily, but as soon as the grant or
funding expires all impact vanishes like nothing was ever done.

In the case of Grassroots Economics programs, a virtual rope to
financial sustainability is lowered into the pit. By leveraging
organizations and structures already in the community, our programs help
individuals to learn about entrepreneurship and how a means of exchange
can help communities to use their own resources more effectively and
efficiently to improve their lives. This change is lasting, sustainable
and can properly be termed development.

Both aid and development have their roles and ways of serving the needs
of the poor, vulnerable, and marginalized. Depending on the context, one
approach may prove superior to the other in tackling tough problems. In
the case of complex emergencies such as weather disasters, aid is vital
to saving lives that very instant. However building strong and resilient
communities requires a different approach. It requires using the
resources available in the community to better provide for its members
and fostering empowerment through education and opportunities. So next
time you hear about a project, ask yourself is it aid or is it
development. You might be surprised at your answer.
