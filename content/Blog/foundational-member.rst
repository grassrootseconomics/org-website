It is sad to announce the sudden death of Dominic Okello (in the middle) who passed on early May 2017. He is a resident of Bangladesh community and also an active community currency member. He has been trading with Sarafu Credit since he joined the network in 2013 and has been a great inspiration to other members of the BN and through his stories he was able to entice others to join the BN. 





The two BN in Mombasa (Ngâ€™ombeni and Bangla) have come together to support the family of the late.
