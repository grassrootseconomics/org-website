In our journey over the last few months building tools for community
currencies on the blockchain to support healthy economies, a network of
550 mothers, teachers, clinics, shop keepers and more have reached 2,614
trades among themselves to support each other while living below the
poverty line. Over 10,900 USD worth of goods and services have been
traded so far representing a significant increase to local trade at a
time when Kenyan Shillings are scarce.

550 users is a relatively small number of businesses, so far, piloting
the currencies. As the networks grow we expect to seem much more trade
as the year progresses and these networks fill out. Fundamentally this
community currency trade shows that the existing fiat based economy only
enables a small fraction of the full capacity of people.

Of these transactions we see primarily food being traded. This is only
the very beginning, as more and more schools and clinics as well as
environmental organizations enroll we expect to see these proportions
change. This data is updated live for every single blockchain
transaction.

Our formula, _so far_ ,for Blockchain Based Community Currencies:

- Bancor Protocol built into the smart contracts enables each
  community currency to be connected to each other
- The POA blockchain allows us to to cheaply and quickly write
  transactions to the blockchain
- The [USSD systems via Africastalking](http://africastalking.com/)
  allow us to make these tokens available to a huge population without
  smart phones or internet
- Creating an initial supply of tokens relative to the population's
  daily consumption of food and airdropping it into micro and small
  businesses, schools and clinics that back the token's value.
- Demurrage or negative interest rates - where if a user is not using
  their tokens for a period of time a percentage of their balance is
  automatically sent to a community fund - which redistributes the
  tokens as a basic income and supports community programs
- Community ambassadors that train and enroll community members and
  braid them together into trading networks.

As we learn from community usage of these tools - we update and improve
these systems and hope all best practices we gather are useful for other
organizations and communities seeking to develop healthy economies.
