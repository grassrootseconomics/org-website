The Berg Rand or BRAND - which means 'Fire' Money in Afrikaans, had an
amazing launch today! The FlowAfrica team lead by John Ziniades and Anna
Cowen of Meshfield spent over 6 months training local youth in topics of
architecture, video creation (see their youtube channel), currency and
businesses development. These youth helped mobilize a network of small
businesses across 3 different towns in the Bergrivier region. The
businesses formed the Bergrivier Exchange Network (BEN) and designed
their own medium of exchange. Similar to Bangla-Pesa and the other
community currencies in Kenya the members of the BEN must be local
prosumers and guaranteed by four other members of the network and must
contribute to a community fund with their BRAND for social service
programs, like trash collection and alien vegetation clearing.

The BRAND will flow through the community connecting supply and demand
when the National Currency (Rand) are scarce. Beyond the empowerment of
the small businesses in the region, the launch of the BRAND was special
in Africa as being the first to be met with support from both a National
Treasury and local municipality. Right now the monetary system of South
Africa does not value 'local' - it values the price of corn in the US
more than it does potatoes grown in South Africa and this is a huge
problem. The Community Currency movemen

t takes over where Crypto-Currencies like BitCoin has faltered by
building local community and valuing local goods and services and their
connection to the environment. Creating community currencies that work
in parallel to national currencies is a holistic grassroots economic
model. It is built around community trust and backed by local goods and
services. This type of money simply makes sense to local businesses by
allowing them to trade even when there is not enough national currency.

What is really exciting about the Flow Program in South Africa is that
they have two very different municipalities taking part. Kokstad
(KwaZuluNatal) (to launch in July) and Bergrivier (Western Cape). These
programs are a new way to empower local businesses to lead the way and
walk and in hand with local government. The BRAND launched today
Pickterberg with spaza shops, farmers, creches, and more have formed an
exchange network for their goods and services. With the levels of both
business and governmental support we've seen in South Africa, we expect
to see substantial increases in the local economy sales revenues and
market stability. See more about the FLOW program at

Our hope is that these programs will create a network of interconnected
community currencies across Africa - to build a truly grassroots
economy.
