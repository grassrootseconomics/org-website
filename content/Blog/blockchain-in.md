Dorothy Nyangara has been using Sarafu for the last one year. She owns a
pharmacy and clinic in Lindi, Kibra (Kenya's largest slum). She uses
Sarafu to purchase food for her family at least four times a week.
Dorothy accepts sarafu from users who come to purchase medicines for
themselves or their children and seek medical checkups. She is happy
that Sarafu is helping her save Kenya Shillings which she uses to pay
for transport to Nairobi CBD whenever she is going to purchase medicines
for her chemist. Her customers see Sarafu as a basic health insurance -
they know that as long as they have it they can get the medicines and
help they need.

Edwin Makori is a hotel owner at Gatina in Kawangware. He joined Sarafu
early 2018 but he was skeptical about using it because he had not seen
its benefits yet. Around June, he started using the digital Sarafu
(Community Currency). Edwin has seen the benefits of Sarafu because he
can now save some Kenyan shillings when he goes to purchase fuel or food
for his cafe. Now he is too excited about Sarafu since more people he
trades with him daily also joined the network. Currently Edwin trades at
least twice a week when he is missing Kenyan Shillings. He is able to
buy raw food and also fuel using Sarafu.

Isaac Naimbona is a shopkeeper in Gatina. He joined Sarafu early last
year through a client that sells fruits using Sarafu. According to him,
Sarafu is beneficial to him since he is able to get food he needs for
his family. He trades daily either on fruits or vegetables just outside
his shop. When asked about his views on Digital blockchain-based system,
he said that it is easier for him since he doesn't have to carry a lot
of money in his wallet and he can see his account history. Also, he says
that he is able to send the fruit seller or the vegetable vendor money
without having to leave his shop. Isaac is excited that last year
December the community he trades with gave him a Christmas gift of some
stock to boost his business.
