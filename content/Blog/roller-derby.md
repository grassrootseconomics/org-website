Last Sunday marked the culmination of partnerships with an unexpected
collection of people who came together to support the education and
reproductive health of school-aged girls in Kenya. The Oklahoma City
Outlaws Roller Derby team (<http://www.okcbankedtrackrollerderby.com/>),
and the 501st Legion (<http://www.501st.com/>), a Star Wars fan club and
charity/volunteer organization, can together for PANTY WARS.

Panty Wars was a special roller derby bout dedicated to collecting
panties and funds for school girls in Kenya. While many school girls
receive sanitary pads through the Government of Kenya, poor and
vulnerable girls frequently lack panties in which to place sanitary
pads. As a result, they miss about a week of school each month during
their periods (read more here link). Derby Girls and the Star Wars fans
alike objected to this unnecessary barrier to girls' education, and they
decided to do something about it.

On the side of the Oklahoma City Outlaws, each fan who came to the bout
with a package of panties received $2 off their ticket. Otherwise, $2
from every ticket was donated to the Panty Project. The owner of the
skate rink also pledged to double the money raised. During halftime, a
video produced by the team at Koru-Kenya and the Roller Girls described
this challenge to the life chances of girls and young women to the
audience could fully understand the cause.

The 501st joined these fundraising efforts months in advance, designing
and marketing a collector's patch featuring the cause and selling the
patches online and at the bout. They brought a team of certified
costumers playing roles form Darth Vader to Princess Leia with whom fans
could interact and have pictures taken. They even brought an R2D2 unit,
dressed in panties, who collected donations after the halftime video.

In total, the event brought in $1350 and 363 pairs of panties. More
donations may follow, but right now, that's another 350 girls provided
with panties! Our expectations for this event were blown away, and we
are incredibly touched by the enthusiasm of strangers for the struggles
of Kenyan girls and young women.

In the next month, we will identify beneficiaries and local partners for
sanitary pad provision, like Wema Centre, who has already been providing
sanitary pads as we provide panties. And then the fun begins, as we hold
reproductive health life skills trainings, providing both the knowledge
and resources (pads and panties) for these girls to keep going to
school, despite their menstrual cycles.
