Title: Sarafu Network Kenya Mid-Year CIC Update
Author: Will Ruddick
Date: Aug 7, 2020
Slug: sarafu-network
Summary: We've reached nearly 90Million worth (~900,000 USD) of Community Inclusion Currency trading between 30,0000 users in Kenya for basic needs.

This year started off intense then became insane starting in April and
through it all the Grassroots Economics team, community groups and
partners managed to do some amazing work to pull communities together to
support each other during crisis.

We've reached nearly 90Million worth (~900,000 USD) of Community
Inclusion Currency trading between 30,0000 users in Kenya for basic
needs in over 300,000 Transactions on a blockchain. When combined with
aid distribution and donor support we have seen over $1 Million USD
worth of trade on the Sarafu Network in Kenya in 74 different
locations/villages. This growth has been via word of mouth - no
advertising! Below you can see the break down of spending in different
areas.

While most Sarafu users are in rural areas such as Kwale, there has been
a huge focus by the Red Cross in piloting in Mukuru since April (an
informall settlement in Nairobi) and the results there speak for
themselves with over 60Million Sarafu (~600,000 USD) traded among
people trying to support eachother during Covid times. The cost of these
programs is a very small fraction (roughly a 17X multiplier) of the
impacts we are seeking and as they become more and more self-sustainable
through village created CICs we expect this multiplier to just keep
increasing. **It's amazing!**

**What's Going on!**

The Sarafu token (CIC) was meant to be a short term solution. We merged
11 Community Currencies last year into the Sarafu token in order to move
to a different set of software with the goal of open up communities to
create their own tokens by February this year.... but we got delayed in
terms of software development. Then Covid hit and we started
distributing more and more Sarafu to the many many more people who
wanted to using it to form barter networks.

Right now we are working hard to enable these community groups shown
above to create their own CIC. They will convert the Sarafu they have
now and the reserve will go into their own tokens. See the training
video to the left. We have a strong field and phone support team that is
making this happen together with Kenya Red Cross.

Economies around the world are in a state of shock, and collapse.
Already fragile communities are really suffering already. Thank goodness
there was a good harvest in Kenya this season - but it won't last long.
We hope these tools will provide a public infrastructure that helps
communities weather this crisis and thrive but the work needs a lot of
support.

**What's Next?**

- We are making steps from Proof of Concept to supporting communities
  across Kenya and continuing to develop open source tools for
  communities around the world.
- As the groups collect their Sarafu this month and next inorder to
  create their own CICs we expect Sarafu trade to drop then multiple
  CIC trade to start in September/October. Excited to see the Sarafu
  token converted / liquidated and its reserve used as the seed
  (collateral pool) for over 40 CICs by the end of this year.
- On the tech side we are extremely excited about
  [bloxberg.org](http://bloxberg.org) and looking at bridging all
  kinds of potential reserve tokens like
  XCHF.
- Expanding on and helping the greater world in understanding the
  basic
  [Potluck](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/how-to-host.html)
  model of CIC creation as it is used in Kenyan villages and
  potentially far beyond.

**What we need!**

- Programmers! See our
  [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/grassrootseconomics/cic-docs/-/blob/master/README.md).
  (also some good links there for training materials)
- Research and data analysis to understand more about how CICs are
  being used and how they can be used / created better.
- Simulation and
  [Modeling](https://gitlab.com/grassrootseconomics/cic-modeling) for
  these systems in different areas.
- Community, faith based and business networks that want to create
  sustainable supply chains and food security.
- Funding! We are only able to build these systems if we can support
  our team.
- Direct Community Support - You, Donors and Impact investors can give
  directly to people in dire need either through CICs or via Mpesa
  right to their telephone in Kenya.
