September marked the first official renewal event for Bangla-Pesa after
more than 2+ years in circulation (Starting in May 2013). The event
featured the neighboring community's Ng'ombeni-Pesa, several local
politicians, the Chief's office, children's choir, several schools and
members. New Bangla-Pesa was printed in Germany (with the support of
Stichting DOEN), with a new expiration date of December 2016.

At the renewal event each active member could return up to 400 expired
Bangla-Pesa to be exchanged Bangla-Pesa with new designs and dates. The
sum of 400 minus the amount they exchange goes directly into the
community fund, to award those members who were able to collect 400
before the event and top back up the community fund. Over 8,000
Bangla-Pesa was exchanged at the event and we expect much more over the
next week. Also presented was a new user guide and a Business Directory
for members of the network.

Also in September was our first formal retreat/workshop with three
Community Currency Trading Networks in Nairobi. The workshop had 30
attendees from the committees and key members and stakeholders from
networks in Kibera (Lindi-Pesa), Kangemi (Kangemi-Pesa) and Kawangware
(Gatina-Pesa) including Nyendo-lernen a program focused on schools in
the area. The retreat covered:

- The current situation of Complementary and Community Currencies
  world wide
- Strategies for new business creation including permaculture based
  school gardens.
- Challenges and Discussion around Community Currency usage
- Sharing and examples from members and school groups on how Community
  Currency is being used effectively.
- Study of the user guide, field guide and directories
- Roles and responsibilities of Business Network Committees
- Savings and Loan programs
- Planning until the end of the year.

Thanks for our guest speakers Guida Santos, Tristan Dissaux, Robin
Gerbaux and Irmgard Wutte.

Finally we are happy to be in anticipation of our first school based
food garden business model as part of the CC trading network. We hope
this garden can feed more than 400 students and the community around
them, and be something we can take to the over 20+ schools currently
using Community Currency.
