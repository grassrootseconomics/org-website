Sarafu-Credit users in five locations around Kenya have increased by
over 83% since January 1st. Our Super Markets and Credit Clearing
Offices in five locations are beginning to develop a strong local
presence but it is our users that do the most to grow these networks by
simply showing how much their trade is increasing. Below are some recent
examples of Sarafu-Credit users in Nairobi and Mombasa:

Mary Akothe (Mama Mboga) located at Gatina Check point started using
Sarafu-Credit early this year. She noticed Sarafu-Credit after realizing
that the credit has enabled most of the businesses around her to be able
to save the money. She has been actively trading with Sarafu-Credit and
says "My business has been improving on a daily basis by increasing
sales due to increase of daily customers who have been using
Sarafu-Credit backing up the Kenyan shilling to purchase goods and
services within the network." She has also been contributing towards
chama savings and will be in a position to get loans to expand her
business. She has been able to purchase more stock using Sarafu-Credit
and this has enabled her business to grow and she is active in
recruiting more and more members along her entire supply chain.

Kennedy Ongweko of Bangladesh community near Mombasa owns a kinyozi
(barber shop) and he has many Sarafu-Credit customers. "I never used to
have a lot of children customers but ever since I registered to be in
the Business

Network all the mamas in the market bring their children to my knyozi
because I accept Sarafu-Credit," he says. In return Kennedy uses
Sarafu-Credit to buy food from the market and also pays for repairs with
it.

Francisca Ayieko or 'Teclar' as known by many people in Bangladesh
community as Teclar uses Sarafu-Credit on a daily basis to sell fresh
water. A 20litre gallon of water goes for 5/= and she accepts the full
value in 5 Sarafu-Credit (in the form of Bangla-Pesa). She was one of
the first traders of BP starting in 2013 and has been active ever since.
"Sarafu-Credit (Bangla-Pesa) has been of great help to me because I
receive a lot of customers fetching my water," she says. "I also sell
a lot of my fish. Sometimes I accept only Sarafu-Credit when one does
not have the Kenya shillings at all instead of accepting debts that I
have to wait to get repaid", she adds.
