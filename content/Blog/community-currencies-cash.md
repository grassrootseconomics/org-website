A few decades ago, the idea of giving money to poor people instead of
food packages and healthcare was almost scandalous. Free money? With no
strings attached? Surely, this was aid gone wrong -- a desperate attempt
to do things differently that was bound to fail.

Today, the evidence for cash transfers as an effective form of aid has
changed the way we think about giving money to the poor, as well as the
methods we use to fight poverty. In December 2018, a number of UN
agencies released a statement that identified "cash-based assistance as
one of the most significant reforms in humanitarian assistance in recent
years". This is just one example of how innovative approaches to old
methods can shift the mentality of an entire industry.

At Grassroots Economics, we believe that poverty alleviation and
innovation go hand in hand. The UN estimates that the gap in financing
to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is $2.5 trillion
per year in developing countries alone. This creates a real crisis for
the humanitarian field. It doesn't matter how effective new methods are
-- they need to be financed. So where will the money come from?

Blockchain-powered community currencies promise to revolutionize how we
do aid. Giving people money will only get you so far. Injecting cash
into stagnant economies doesn't change the underlying structure of those
cash-strapped, underutilized networks. The real challenge is creating
socio-economic value systems that are rooted in vibrant, cohesive and
resilient communities.

In order to do this, communities need to be empowered to turn cash
circulation into economic activity. A cash transfer recipient who still
has to commute 4 hours to grind their maize is still burdened by the
fact that key products and services aren't available in their area. As a
result, most of the money that goes into the community goes straight out
again, making no difference to local business growth, employment
opportunities or access to resources.

The Sarafu network is a community currency system that has existed for
nearly a decade in Kenya. We give people the power to define money in
their own terms, where value is backed by the productive assets of the
community. In other words, instead of giving cash, we enable mutual
credit. Using Bancor's blockchain API, we've been able to see the
real-time growth of robust economic networks. Token data offers powerful
insights on demurrage (negative interest rates), incentive structures
and promoting economic resilience and development. When people use
Sarafu to trade with each other, pay for school fees, or start a
business, they're making sure that the credit that enters the community
stays there.

Bill Gates and Silicon Valley can't finance the gaps that exist in the
developing world. Poor communities don't lack demand, or labour, or
ideas. They lack a medium of exchange to deploy their under-utilized
resources. When people are empowered to create that medium of exchange
for themselves, they're able to kickstart stagnant economies and create
value where there previously was none.

This is how you build prospering economies powered by thriving
communities. For more information on our work in Kenya, visit our blog.
