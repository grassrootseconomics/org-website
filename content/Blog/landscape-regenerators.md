## Dear Fellow Land Regenerators

We are thrilled that Grassroots Economics Foundation has been selected among nearly 30 projects by [Ma Earth](https://maearth.com/) for a significant fundraising initiative on the [Gitcoin](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/643) platforms. We are doing well in this drive and appreciate the collective effort of each project involved.


### **Commitment Pool: A Common Resource for Mutual Service**

With the funds raised, we will seed a **[Land Regenerators Commitment Pool](https://sarafu.network/pools/0x8322691F378022e18F9D1f346f217118AA861831)**—a common resource pool that you, our fellow Land Regenerators, can access. The aim of this pool is to support and enhance service sharing among us all, giving each of you reciprocal drawing rights to exchange the services you offer within this commons.

For example the services that Grassroots Economics can offer are:

1. A stay in our Eco Lodge guest house in Kilifi, Kenya
2. Mangrove estuary to ocean paddle boarding trips
3. Cultural immersion visits for traditional resource coordination and stewardship
4. Landscape design, ecosystem restoration,syntropic agroforestry and permaculture
5. Visionary Approach to Community Action Planning Sessions
6. Community Asset Vouchers and Commitment Pooling training and support
7. Custom software, technical integrations and blockchain support
8. General consulting and idea sharing.  \


We invite you to join us in this endeavor by offering your services to be exchanged within the pool. The pool will function through a voucher system where your services, defined as **Community Asset Vouchers (CAVs)**, are formalized commitments that any of us can redeem for your unique offerings. Check out [Grassroots Economics’ Voucher](https://sarafu.network/vouchers/0xE4ac86F6a06164A3301fF4957eF4B93551f752f0) as an example.


### **How the Commitment Pool Works**

1. **Create an Account on Sarafu.Network** Begin by creating your account on[ Sarafu.Network](https://sarafu.network) to participate in the voucher system. Either by connecting a wallet or creating a paper wallet. 
2. **Create a Voucher** Publish a voucher on Sarafu.Network describing your commitment to service. This voucher will represent your contribution and can be redeemed within the pool. Instructions can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPUExzwZAUpbHaJU7TIku7vpZ6q_yggQZ).
3. **Inform Us
**Notify us by emailing [info@grassecon.org](mailto:info@grassecon.org) with the name and link to your voucher for verification and addition to the Commitment Pool.
4. **Utilize the Pool** Once your voucher is approved, it will have access to the [Land Regenerators Commitment Pool](https://sarafu.network/pools/0x8322691F378022e18F9D1f346f217118AA861831), allowing you to exchange/swap your vouchers for funding, services or resources from other projects in the pool.


### **Expanding the Pool and Network of Pools**

You are welcome to seed the pool with your vouchers or funds, enhancing the resource diversity and support available for all members. Donors are also encouraged to contribute to this shared pool, fostering a resilient ecosystem of mutual service. You can also create your own pool.

Our approach to **Commitment Pooling** is inspired by [ancestral wisdom](https://youtu.be/49zgjjFukFQ), where pooled commitments for services bring community resilience. Together, let’s create a collaborative economy that aligns our projects' strengths and sustains our shared mission.

Thank you for your contributions and commitment you have already shown in your work.

Please feel free to book an appointment with m e and I’ll walk you through it all personally. 


Looking forward to working with you!

Sincerely, 

Will Ruddick
