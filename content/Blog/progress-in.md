One of our partner programs in South Africa was recently featured on the
news.

"An exciting new era may be dawning for the Kokstad community as it
promises to boost the economy and save money, not only for businesses,
but also for the community. This phenomenon will be brought about with
the proposed introduction of the K-rand, a currency exclusive to
Kokstad. This was revealed at a presentation made by Fostering Local
Well-being (Flow) ambassadors at the Kokstad community hall on
Tuesday. Kokstad has been selected as one of two towns for a national
Treasury-funded pilot project being conducted in conjunction with
University of Cape Town to test the idea, which is successful in other
parts of the world."
