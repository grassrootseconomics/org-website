Across Kenya, the spirit of mutual aid is making a non-monetary comeback. In more than 150 clusters identified in our Trust Graph shown above, traditional practices like "Mwerthia" in Kikuyu culture and "Mwerya" in Giriama culture are being revitalized. Now, each cluster represent providers of local goods and service among groups that have created their own unique Community Asset Vouchers (CAVs) for accounting credit and debt, all recorded anonymously on the Celo Blockchain.

## Trust Graph: The Vital Stats

1. Total Clusters: 150 (label propagation algorithm)
2. Unique Nodes: 3,070
3. Total Edges: 50,000+
4. Total Weight: 78,845 exchanges (over a three month period)

Community Asset Vouchers are not just digital tokens; they're promises for local goods and services and embodiment of trust and cooperation. Developed uniquely for each village, these CAVs are open-source and can be created by anyone globally via [Sarafu Network](https://sarafu.network).

## Data Transparency with Anonymity
All the data driving this Trust Graph is sourced from anonymous Celo Blockchain, ensuring both transparency and privacy. The total weight of 78,845 represents the sum of reciprocal interactions within these clusters. Each weight point signifies a reciprocal exchange, reflecting the flow of credit and mutual aid within the community.

## Bridging the Old and the New
The blend of blockchain tech with traditional mutual aid practices has created a robust, transparent, and adaptable system. It has turned informal mutual aid arrangements into accountable, interconnected networks. It's important to note that successful CAVs are not currencies (widespread media of exchange) but rather clear commitments for goods and services made by individuals and community groups. 

This Trust Graph isn't just data; it's a living testament to community resilience and mutual aid across Kenya. With 80+ unique CAVs, 150 distinct clusters, 3,070 businesses, and 78,845 exchanges, this graph illustrates the adaptability and widespread nature of mutual aid networks in contemporary Kenya. It's a blueprint of community vitality, one that can be replicated and adapted globally through open source platforms like [Sarafu Network](https://sarafu.network)..
