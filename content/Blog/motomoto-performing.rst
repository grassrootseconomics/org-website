We've started off the year with two new MotoMoto classes on Tuesday and Thursdays in Mombasa thanks to Burners without Borders. Each class consists of ten street living youth. We've begun giving them food after each session as a way of giving them focus. 



 



One of the students is George Kamau . George dropped out of school in second grade because his parents could not pay his school fees. He hasn't been able to find work and has lost hope. He is now addicted to glue sniffing. We hope to see George making it all the way through the program and eventually off the streets.
