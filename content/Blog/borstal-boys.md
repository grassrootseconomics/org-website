The MotoMoto Program is helping make a difference at the Shimo La Tewa
Borstal Institution which houses 313 boys from all over Kenya. It's one
of only two such institutions in all of Kenya, with teenagers serving
sentences for everything from petty theft (of even just a few dollars)
to murder. For many, they came to the Borstal following conflicts with
family, who then reported them to the police for petty theft or drug
use. They would much rather be in the "Approved Schools," which are also
institutions for violent or unmanageable youth, but which offer
secondary school services by government teachers. Instead, these boys
stay in the Borstal, which does not offer secondary school and where the
few years of primary school which are offered are taught by guards
rather than teachers. The boys can, however, pursue one vocational
skill; tailoring, farming, wiring, carpentry, or masonry, which they
chose following their first 2 months in the institution.

The Borstal boys wake up around 5am every day. They cook their own
breakfast (as they do with all other meals), clean the kitchen
afterward, clean their rooms, sweep the common areas, and do whatever
yard work is necessary for the compound. In the hours when they are not
doing chores, they attend their vocational skills classes. At 4pm, they
have diner and then return to their rooms, shared among 4 or more boys,
for the rest of the evening.

However, Koru recently introduced a new element to the routine for 20
Borstal Boys, poi performing art and life skills. Since February, our
poi and life skills coaches have gone to the Borstal on Fridays for a 1
hour poi lesson and a 1 hour life skills session. They work with boys
ages 13-17 in the prison yard, surrounded by fences, barbed wire, and
guards at all times. Unsurprisingly, the boys love this distraction,
begging both coaches to stay even after the allotted time is finished.

Antone Karuki is one of our most promising new poi students. Like most
of the Borstal residents (less than 5% of whom come from Mombasa),
Antone was arrested for smoking marihuana far from Shimo La Tewa, in his
home region of Kiambu, north of Nairobi. He was sentenced to 3 years in
November, 2013, but will be released on probation after 1 year. After
the first poi lesson, Antone made his own poi from grass and flexible
sticks, preferring to practice with a highly imperfect instrument,
rather than wait for the next lesson. He's now perfected forward weaves
and actively teaches others, who listen because of this natural
leadership skills. Antone also actively engages in life skills
discussions. He's learned how to identify and cope with challenges as
they arise, as well as learning how to nurture high self-esteem despite
these challenges. He's working on his masonry certification and hopes to
go back to secondary school in November, even though his classmates
would be years younger than himself.

Most of the Borstal boys made one or two really bad decisions, which
have long term, negative consequences for their lives, interrupting
their education, separating them from their families, exposing them to
all the indignities and dehumanization which comes from living in a
total institution like a prison. Although the prison offers vocations
skills, many of these boys will struggle to return to school, which
limits their employment opportunities into the future. We hope to fight
against the loss of self-esteem and despair which might accompany these
setbacks by giving the boys something to be proud of, their poi skills,
and providing them with life skills to cope with the heavier challenges
of their lives now and in the future.
