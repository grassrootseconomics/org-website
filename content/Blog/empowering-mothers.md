We are joining together to celebrate mothers' lives. It is no secret
that being a mother is like no other job in the world. It is a job that
never ends and that demands the uttermost dedication. As daughters,
grandmothers, fathers, brothers and sons we have come to understand of
what commitment, extravagant grace and creativity looks like.

But even though the ripples of their work are present every day in our
lives we can sometimes forget to be grateful and take their efforts for
granted. Because of this we want to use this opportunity to celebrate
the lives of these women and to make sure that they know how much we
appreciate them.

This post goes out then to all women out there, in Bangladesh, Miyani,
Lindi, Gatina, Ng'ombeni and Kangemi who are using community currencies
to help support their children and ensure their offspring have the best
possible chances in life. With the increase of income, women use most of
the resources to improve the standard of living of their families above
all other expenses. We have seen these heroines working with
Sarafu-Credit to overcome the daunting obstacles that have previously
kept their families in cyclical poverty. These mothers are breaking the
chains of circumstances and rising to the opportunity to ensure food
security and education for the next generation. The importance of their
endeavors cannot be underestimated, women become the pillars of
development on which their communities are built upon.

Zainabu, member of the Sarafu-Credit in Miyani, recalls the day when
women came together to dig special pits to store water where they would
eventually plant maize and legumes: "That time was special because I got
paid in Sarafu-Credit from the community shop, this means when am done
digging I can go to the community posho mill to mill my maize and have
lunch ready for my children when they come from school. It also means I
can go to other community members to buy vegetables or fruits to add to
the meals!" - Testimonial collected by Caroline Dama

"My daughter used not to go to school because I did not have enough
money. I decided to let the boys go and let the girl stay at home. But
ever since I joined the BN, I was able to use the CC on my daily needs
like food and water and save enough money such that I was able to enroll
my daughter to school."

Ever since I joined the network I started receiving many more people who
come to fetch my water. Because I accept SC I get more customers."

feed and take good care of her granddaughter Caro by using of
Sarafu-Credit. - Testimonial collected by Lydia Anyango
