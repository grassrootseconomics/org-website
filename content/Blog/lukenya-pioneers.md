**A Historic First in Sustainable Community-Based Finance**

Lukenya University School of Business and Economics (LUSOBE) has made history by becoming the **first university in the world to implement an interest-free student loan system using commitment pooling via Sarafu.Network on Celo Blockchain.** Inspired by ancient reciprocal labor traditions and Islamic finance principles—specifically [Waqf](https://grassecon.org/wafq)—the university has launched an innovative digital commitment pool that is set to transform the way students, staff, and vendors access financial support.


### **LUSOBE Commitment Pool and Voucher Pilot**

On **February 9, 2025,** in Mtito Andei, Kenya, LUSOBE launched its pilot program, training vendors, university staff, and students on the ethical and financial benefits of WAQF-based financing. The system allows users to access resources and credit without relying on interest-based financial models.

This initiative builds on the success of the **Resilient Communities Waqf (RCW) project** (shown above), which previously piloted commitment pooling models to support shopkeeper credit and community financing in Kilifi County. By integrating these lessons, Lukenya University has established **LUKUNI**—a university-backed commitment pool supported by an initial endowment of **USD 522.51** from Grassroots Economics Foundation (GEF) and RCW.


### **The Model: A Community-Based Voucher System**

At the heart of this model is the **LUSOBE voucher**, a university-specific financial tool that facilitates credit transactions between students, vendors, and university staff. This voucher system operates within the **Sarafu.Network**, ensuring transparent, decentralized financial coordination.


#### **How It Works**



1. **Endowments Seed the Pool** – An initial contribution of USD 522.51 kickstarted the system, allowing for credit issuance.
2. **Credit Committee Oversight** – A dedicated team, including top university officials and faculty from Lukenya University's School of Business and Economics, as well as support from Grassroots Economics Foundation, ensures responsible financial governance.
3. **Vendor and User Participation** – Select vendors, staff, and students were invited to join the pilot, with **34 active accounts** already operational in just three weeks.
4. **Transaction Volume** – Over **219 transactions totaling KES 204,950** have already taken place, significantly exceeding the 50,000 issued LUSOBE vouchers. LUSOBE holders exchange the LUSOBE among each other and anyone on Sarafu.Network as well as exchange them in the [Lukenya University Pool](https://sarafu.network/pools/0xB1a711609914A6A7281f4B0D0D2a52d82F48d884) for a zero interest student loan. 
5. **Scalability and Expansion** – With growing demand, more students and staff are eager to join, highlighting the need for additional funding to expand access.

### **LUSOBE Funds First Interest-Free Student Loan**

On **February 24, 2025**, the Interest-Free Student Loan Facility underwent its first real-world test when **Abdullahi, a Lukenya University student**, faced an urgent tuition shortfall of **KES 10,000** to sit for his exams. Through **LUSOBE’s Student Tuition Fee Interest-Free Loan Facility**, he was granted an emergency loan, allowing him to continue his education without financial stress.

Incredibly, just **five days later**, Abdullahi repaid the full amount—demonstrating the model’s viability and reinforcing the principle that students, when given financial breathing space, can uphold their commitments responsibly.


### **A Future of Financial Resilience**

As March approaches, **Lukenya University is gearing up for expansion**. Plans include:



* **Attracting more endowments** to expand pool access to additional students and vendors.
* **Academic research and documentation** to refine and responsibly replicate the model.
* **Showcasing LUSOBE at the Lukenya University [10 Million Trees" Marathon](https://marathon.lukenyauniversity.ac.ke/homepage/)**, a major event with nationwide media coverage.

This initiative is a **blueprint for sustainable, community-based finance**, providing an alternative to exploitative loan systems while fostering collective resilience.
