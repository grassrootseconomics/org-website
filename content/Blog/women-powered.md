_It is Women who make up as much as 90% of these networks and are the
foundation of the real economy. Enjoy reading about people supporting
each other in ways we never though possible without National Currency!
Special shout out for for International Women's Day !_

Below you will find examples of use cases in 4 neighboring communities
in Nairobi slums using Sarafu (a group of Community Currencies which are
Bancor Protocol enabled tokens on the POA.Network blockchain ) to
support each other and develop a resilient economy.

We've never been able to link currencies together like this before and
now have 9 currencies in circulation among 1,136 businesses, clinics and
schools with 516,436 Tokens that have traded in one month a volume of
837,355 tokens (soft-pegged to Kenyan Shillings) in 11,155 Transactions
for Food 34.4% Labour 25.9%Retail 19.2% Education 7.2% Freight / Travel
5.5% Water 3.3% Energy 2.3% Environment 2.0% Health 0.4% Using the
Bancor Protocol each community promotes reciprocity and resilience by
actively measuring trade imbalances through their relative currency
values. See if you can see how these currencies are interwoven in the
examples below.

**Susan Lukobo** joined Sarafu 4 years ago. Ever since she joined Sarafu
(using Congo Pesa her communities currency), she is able to pay
teacher's salaries on time, she has her pupils in class everyday every
week, she no longer sends pupils home for school fees since her parents
pay fee in Sarafu. She repairs desks from a carpenter who uses Sarafu
and her school cook is able to buy lunch at a cheaper rate since she
purchases from the Sarafu users.

**Teacher Eric Mwaka** joined sarafu four years ago. Sarafu has helped
him save Kenya shillings as he is able to purchase his basic needs from
other Sarafu users and in return he offers tuition their children. The
amount in Kenya shillings that he is able to save on daily basis, he
sends it to his family who are in the village.

**Phostina** is a carpenter who joined Sarafu 1 month ago. Initially she
was accepting desk repairs from Skylife Academy but they were not paying
on daily basis due to scarcity of Kenya shillings. When she was
introduced to Sarafu, she liked the idea because the school always
supplement the Kenya shillings with sarafu. She is now having more
customers and she is in a position to sell her excess capacity
(firewood, bed, sofa sets and cabinets) using Sarafu. Teachers have been
buying beds, sofa sets and cabinets from her . Phostina also uses Sarafu
to pay school fees for the daughter who studies in the nearest community
(kangemi). She pays her workers in Sarafu also.

**Doris** owns a hotel near the carpenter and the school. She joined
Sarafu 3 months ago. She is able to use Sarafu to buy firewood from
Phostina . When teachers discovered that she joined Sarafu, they have
been eating in her hotel. She is now having more customers who generate
more income to her.

**2. GATINA**

**Jackline Kasiva** has been a member of Sarafu network for the last 9
months. Initially she never had clients on daily basis since people
don't plait hair every day. She could end up spending a day or two
without clients. Others who came with less money were not plaited since
she preferred money for every service offered. When she joined Sarafu,
she no longer sends her clients back with the little Kenya shillings
that they bring, in fact she encourages them to supplement with Sarafu
and she is able to plait them. Sarafu has made her expand her business.
She is also saving Kenya shillings whenever she spent Sarafu and now she
is not only plaiting hair but she is also selling the hair products.

**Jacinta Mutumi** is a tailor based in Gatina. She joined sarafu 5
months ago and she is happy that Sarafu made her get more customers who
want their clothes mended or want their children's uniform repaired. She
was able to save Kenya shillings which she used to take her son to high
school with it. She uses Sarafu to plait her hair and also get
vegetables from her neighbour.

**Elizabeth Achacha** has a vegetables kiosk. Initially she was selling
vegetables alone and she could sleep (go home) with some of the greens
which are perishable. She joined Sarafu 2 years ago and has been able to
utilize her excess capacity. None of her stock goes bad as before and
she has also expanded her business - from selling vegetables alone to
now selling tomatoes and onions alongside the vegetables.

able to save ksh 50 when she purchased omena for her family from mama
Sharon. She has 2 children who got a haircut from Walter last week. The
two children go to school using a boda boda who lucky enough joined

needs without using the scarce Kenyan currency.

**Pastor Silvanous** joined Sarafu 3 years ago. He is the main pastor of
Hope Gospel Center. The congregation pays their tithes and offerings to
him in form of Sarafu. He uses the same amount to go back to the
congregation to purchase basic needs. He has also rented the church to a
school and in return he receives rent in Sarafu. The pastor told us that
his congregants are happy to use Sarafu in his church (as
Tithing/Sadaka) and he accepts it since he will still go back to the
congregants to get his basic needs. He says that Sarafu has united them
and as a church they have now started a savings scheme due to Sarafu.
