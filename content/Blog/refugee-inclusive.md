**Responding to Refugee Crisis**

This is the current and biggest humanitarian global crisis in our
lifetimes and we all need to play a part.

**"We are now witnessing the highest levels of displacement on
record**. An unprecedented 70.8 million people around the world have
been forced from home. Among them are nearly 25.9 million refugees, over
half of whom are under the age of 18. There are also millions of
stateless people who have been denied a nationality and access to basic
rights such as education, healthcare, employment and freedom of
[movement.In](http://movement.In) a world where nearly 1 person is
forcibly displaced every two seconds as a result of conflict or
persecution" - [UNHCR](http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html)

Our dream is supporting social and economic inclusion of refugees
worldwide by developing and enabling Refugee Inclusive Community
Currencies (RICCs). With this hope Grassroots Economics has partnered
with Red Cross and Bancor on a plan to apply Community Currency systems
in such humanitarian crisis. This plan was jointly submitted to GSMA and
Department for International Development (DFID) as part of the 3rd round
of their results based financing grant pool. This new financial
infrastructure bridges credit gaps, empowers micro-entrepreneurs in low
income communities and refugee camps to establish their own financial
independence, and builds thriving regional economies.

A short description of the program and technology can be found

- Donations and Cash Transfer funds the initial reserve for the
  creation of RICCs tokens
- Red Cross, together with Grassroots Economics, works with a local
  community to ensure buy-in and understanding and trains local
  ambassadors who train users and distribute RICCs for local barter
  trade among regional communities.
- Local circulation of RICCs among and between communities enables
  economic development and integration while gathering evidence for
  those who should receive additional aid.
- KYC'ed users are able to convert RICCs to eMoney and the aid pool
  can be refilled through local and international support and
  investment.

**Previous Success with Grassroots Economics and Red Cross working to
end Chronic Need:**

Grassroots Economics came in at the tail end of a Cash For Work program
in (Red Cross Kwale-Kenya and WFP). We were invited into the existing
Red Cross organized and trained group in Miyani Village and empowered
them with the ability to create their own voucher system with the goal
of continuing the Red Cross communal farming efforts. The vouchers
(Miyani-Pesa) have enabled the community to pay their members to do the
communal farming work in the same manner as Red Cross - and the
community accepts the vouchers back in many locations (such as maize
milling) - creating local circulation and economic development (going
back to an economy that thrived over a hundred years in their culture
pre-colonization). In the area around Miyani there are currently close
to 2000 users of the Vouchers (now blockchain Tokens with the Bancor
Protocol) trading roughly 500,000 Kenyan shillings a month for basic
food security and other needs. The Miyani FDP (Food Distribution Point).
**Due to this work the Miyani Group that Red Cross developed and trained
to do Cash For Work is the only one remaining in the entire county still
doing their communal activities due.**
