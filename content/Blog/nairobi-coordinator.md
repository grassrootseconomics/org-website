For the first three months I started working as a volunteer. I am able
to get in touch with different business individuals in all the three
business networks that include Kangemi, Gatina and Lindi that are
located in the urban slums. Through interacting with them I was able to
understand how they operate their businesses, what they lack and what
they don't, learnt new business ideas. Among other things I discovered
that through community currency, members in each business network
increased the number of customers and also the number of sales that they
made in a day.

- During the Market day events different business individuals meet
  at a specific point where they traded together and exchanged ideas
  on how to improve their businesses, that is a social impact.
- Education has also been made easier since the students can be able
  to acquire their tuition without no hustles.
- Transport has been made accessible since Bodaboda that are in the
  business networks have been able to transport goods/products from
  the suppliers to the retailers shop.
- Members in each business network never lack market for their
  commodities.
- Whenever I visit each business individual, I always attend to and
  try to solve their issues such as teaching them book keeping; the
  knowledge helps them improve ways on how they can operate their
  businesses.
- Members have been able to come up with ideas such as Chama
  savings, table banking and are able to issue loans amongst
  themselves to expand their businesses.
- Use of the community currency has enabled members to be able to
  save Kenya Shillings by using Sarafu-Credit (Community Currency.
- There has been an increase in the number of users that is more
  business members joining the business networks increasing
  community currency circulation. We have more than 800 users in
  Nairobi.
- Members of each community network have been able to form cluster
  groups that has made easier for them to hold meetings and do their
  weekly and monthly savings in Kenya shillings.
- Members have been able to do or hold community events such as
  Voluntary Community clean ups that helps the community secure the
  clean environment, Sports is also involved.
- Community currency has enabled families not to lack food on the
  table since they can purchase food using community currency.
- Training of members has enabled others members using that
  knowledge to train other members who do not understand the concept
  behind community currency (trainer of trainers).
- Community currency has enabled unity among members enabling them
  solve their own issues apart from using the cc, this has brought
  understanding amongst themselves that is healthy in a community
  thriving towards prospering economies. This means that when they
  come together great things happen.
