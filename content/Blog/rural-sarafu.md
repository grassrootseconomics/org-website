Rosemary Owino is a widow from Siaya village in Siaya County. She has
wanted desperately to curb her own poverty and make ends meet for the 6
children that are under her care. She started a fish business where she
buys fish, smokes or fries them and sells to the people in her community
under a tree in their local market - but because Kenyan Shillings are so
scarce there are few people to buy her fish.

She was able to join a women's group (chama) called Kwe Kende - A group
that trades and supports each other using Sarafu (a Community Inclusion
Currency (CIC) which is created and traded on a blockchain using simple
feature phones with no internet). Through this chama, Rosemary has been
able to find support within the network and she has been able to sell
her fish in both Sarafu and Kenyan Shillings.

Rosemary cites that Sarafu has created possibility for sustainable
living within her community. Through Sarafu, her fish sales have
increased and she has been able to save the Kenyan Shillings that she
then uses to pay her children's school fee. She has also been able to
meet her needs through getting other goods like: flour, tomatoes,
vegetables, water and charcoal among other goods from the Sarafu users
in her network.

Rosemary is grateful to use Sarafu and says "It helps me practice the
sharing our pastors preach in church". She is hopeful that through the
use of Sarafu, her business will continue to thrive and be of great
impact to the people in her community.

Overall the [Sarafu
Network](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/sarafu-network) of CIC
users in Kenya is comprised primarily of 40,000 users in both urban and
rural areas. Roughly 50% of the network is rural and has traded over
100Million Sarafu tokens this year (valued locally at roughly 1 Million
USD of goods and services) between each other to offer basic support and
trade goods and services. The majority of the trade is for contributions
to chamas and church groups, food stuffs, farming and other labor. In
October 2020 rural users traded over 8Million Sarafu among each other
for food stuffs alone.

The economic outlook in rural Kenya is not good right now; as less and
less Kenyan Shillings reach rural areas markets have began to collapse.
CICs like Sarafu help keep markets moving and communities together.

Special thanks to Emma Onyango - one of the founding members of
Bangla-Pesa - who came out to Siaya to teach this Rosemary and her chama
how they can support themselves with community currency.
