In 1982, the late Dr. Margrit Kennedy's work on ecological architecture
led her to the conclusion that it is "virtually impossible to carry out
sound ecological concepts on the scale required today, without
fundamentally altering the present money system or creating new
complementary currencies." Now in 2014, at this advanced stage in
global capitalism it is evident that alternative economic development
programs must go hand in hand with environmental and community
development programs. With these conclusions in mind, Koru-Kenya has
piloted complementary currencies as tools for poverty reduction and
environmental restoration in Kenya since 2010. Based on the successes of
pilot programs like Bangla-Pesa and Eco-Pesa we envision here their
applicability in large scale environmental restoration and community
development efforts.

Complementary currency systems for this purpose begin with knitting
together a network of goods and service providers in an area surrounding
environmental degradation and social needs. This business network
develops a mutual-credit voucher among its members to exchange goods and
services. Such credits promote economic development by providing a
supplementary means of exchange when poverty and economic instability
make national currency scarce. Members of the network can also use the
voucher to pay local community associations for resource permits which
then in turn pay for environmental management and preservation. Because
the voucher is only redeemable with local businesses, the system
promotes local trade and economic stability. Thus, the local community's
mandated payments to support resource management and other programs are
in turn used to promote the local economy.

Non-local businesses and other development actors can also take part
through a matching funds program. Often community development and
environmental programs need more than what a local community can provide
in terms of local goods, labor and services. They also need
infrastructure, like construction materials and expert training. The
community collects membership fees in the mutual-credit that can be
target local programs. Because these credits are backed by the goods and
services of local businesses, they are an ideal means to measure how
committed a community will be in joint development or environmental
programs. This community fund in mutual-credit complementary currency is
what we would like to see corporations and governments matching in
national currency to actualize real development, lead by the communities
themselves.

These programs working on large regional scales is not only possible,
but necessary, to carry out sustainable ecological and community
programs on the scale required today.
