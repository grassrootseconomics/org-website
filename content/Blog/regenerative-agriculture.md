The 17th of December 2020, I visited Syntropic Agroforestry demo plots
with Wilfred Chibwara in Kwale which are utilizing community currency to
support setup and maintenance and will be redeemed for food as harvest
begin. Thanks to initial trainings by
[Roland](https://www.facebook.com/roland.vanreenen) they have come a
long way from when they
[started](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/post/food-forests-and-syntropic-currencies).
Special thanks to Mwanaidi Ibrahim, Naduwa Mwero and Jacob Mwatumbi for
all their hard work! Here are my observations and recommendations:

**Visit to Miyani Syntropic Agroforestry Farm.**

In the first demo plot, besides the trees, bananas, and casava different
crops were planted including maize, cucumber and okra. Currently, maize
has matured and will be harvested soon! It is looking much better than
nearby mono-cropped farms which we hope will soon adopt the technique.
Cucumber and okra will also start producing in the coming weeks. A few
more crops are now being planted including kale and capsicum but the
planting is very sparse.

After maize is harvested, all the maize stalks should be used for
mulching the beds. When harvesting maize ensure that the root mass of
the maize remains intact in the soil. (Don't uproot it!). Only chop the
upper part of the maize stalks and let the roots remain and decompose in
the soil.

Another tall crop such as sunflower should be planted to replace the
maize. Sunflower is drought resistant hence can survive with little
water in the dry season. After 3 months, during the onset of the long
rains in March/April. The sunflower will be ready to be harvested, seeds
dried and used as food (roasted sunflower seeds or used as chicken
feeds). Sunflower stalks can be chopped and dropped as mulch therefore
enriching the soil.

Recommendations.

- **Ensure that the soil is completely covered with thick mulch.**
  This can be any type of plant matter be it grass, weeds and tree
  leaves. Cover the entire bed, on top and the sides. Secondly, mulch
  all the paths with logs and tree branches. Mulching will help
  preserve water in the soil and keep off weeds. Additionally, when
  the mulch decomposes it will add into the soil organic matter.
- **Start planting a living hedge around the demo plots.** This will
  act as a windbreak and a sunscreen to reduce the intensity of the
  sun. The plot is highly exposed to the elements and would result in
  slow growth of crops.
- **Plant intensively and diverse crops in every space.** Currently,
  only a few crops have been planted. These crops are also sparsely
  planted. This is not efficient use of space and water. Fill up all
  the empty spaces with different crops such as nitrogen fixers e.g
  cow peas (kunde) and pigeon peas (mbaazi), insect repellents such as
  dhania and lemon grass to keep away pests, flowering crops to
  attract pollinators and pest predators and increase the the number
  of biomass crops. These include vetiver grass, moringa, nappier
  grass and tithonia. This will ensure that there's continuous
  production of biomass which will be used to cover and build the
  soil.

It takes a while to get accustomed to how intensely one can plant when
coming from the usual mono-crop farming - [Kai

In conclusion, the group has done a great job in starting up the
projects. Seeing even this level of growth in a semi-arid environment
that was classified as food-insecure is amazing. However, the groups
will need support on the succession in the next round of crops and to
continue monitoring. The motivation of the community given by accepting
community currency will eventually be repaid with their ability to use
it to purchase food from the farm. Motivation to continue maintaining
the gardens is especially important during the first year of
establishment. This is due to the fact that during the first year
that's when most of the challenges crop up, such as pests and disease,
crop failures and building of the soil.

**I look forward to supporting them through this journey!**
