In the last few weeks we have seen the largest usage of community currencies we have ever, reaching near 7k USD traded daily among thousands of people living below the poverty line in rural villages and urban settlements. We are proud to be part of supporting and spreading these open source solutions as far as possible.



Check out the Community Inclusion Currency `(CIC) Dashboard <https://dashboard.sarafu.network>`_ build by an amazing team at Accenture for even more data views and also see our `research page <https://grassecon.org/research>`_.


In 30 days we have seen that by injecting a medium of exchange in the form of CICs nearly 100,000 USD have been traded (with over 1,600 daily transactions on the xDAI blockchain) among vulnerable communities at a cost of 8k USD in National Currency - this is roughly 12x the impact of typical donor funds and we expect to see it grow.

Anyone with a sim card can be a CIC recipient of an initial 400 tokens which can be used with other users and supporting businesses. Users receive addition CICs daily based on their usage. Savings groups receive donations in Mpesa (national currency) based on their CIC usage. 



CIC circulation keeps supply chains running so that communities can do as much as possible to support each other when there is not enough money, food, soap, water and so on.
