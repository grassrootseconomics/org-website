Nairobi's Dagoretti North MP. Hon. Paul Simba Arati will be attending
the launch of Gatina-Pesa in October. Besides support from local chiefs,
having the interest of the area MP means a lot in terms of political
endorsement for the first sister currency to Bangla-Pesa in Kenya.

It's not often that a community realizes they have a wealth of untapped
supply and demand for local goods and services and can create their own
medium of exchange to match them. With Bangla-Pesa having traded roughly
over 2 million shillings worth of goods and service since it's relaunch
in November last year, this first attempt to duplicate the program in
Nairobi gives us hope that regional economies built from the ground up
are not only possible but inevitable.

Meanwhile we're working hard to spell out good implementation
strategies and standards for such programs, so that marginalized
communities around the world can take action.

In Nairobi we've got a long way to go in terms of registering enough
small businesses to reach a critical mass before launch but the team is
making a huge effort. Richard Ogolla is leading the registration efforts
and doing a great job.

While schools have been the heart of the network in Kawangware Richard
has reached out to boda-bodas, maize millers, and so many different
kinds of businesses. Dramas are being prepared to explain to people how
the program works. The community's designs of the Gatina-Pesa have gone
to the printers in Germany and with a little bit more push for awareness
we're looking forward to a powerful launch. As Morgan Richards would
say - we're cautiously optimistic.
