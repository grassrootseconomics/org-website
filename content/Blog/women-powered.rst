*It is Women who make up as much as 90% of these networks and are the foundation of the real economy. Enjoy reading about people supporting each other in ways we never though possible without National Currency!  Special shout out for for International Women's Day !*


 



Below you will find examples of use cases in 4 neighboring communities in Nairobi slums using Sarafu (a group of Community Currencies which are Bancor Protocol enabled tokens on the POA.Network blockchain ) to support each other and develop a resilient economy.  



 



We've never been able to link currencies together like this before and now have 9 currencies in circulation among 1,136 businesses, clinics and schools with 516,436 Tokens that have traded in one month a volume of 837,355 tokens (soft-pegged to Kenyan Shillings) in 11,155 Transactions for Food 34.4% Labour 25.9%Retail 19.2% Education 7.2% Freight / Travel 5.5% Water 3.3% Energy 2.3% Environment 2.0% Health 0.4%  Using the Bancor Protocol each community promotes reciprocity and resilience by actively measuring trade imbalances through their relative currency values. See if you can see how these currencies are interwoven in the examples below.

**Susan Lukobo** joined Sarafu 4 years ago. Ever since she joined Sarafu (using Congo Pesa her communities currency), she is able to pay teacher’s salaries on time, she has her pupils in class everyday every week, she no longer sends pupils home for school fees since her parents pay fee in Sarafu. She repairs desks from a carpenter who uses Sarafu and her school cook is able to buy lunch at a cheaper rate since she purchases from the Sarafu users.

**Phostina** is a carpenter who joined Sarafu 1 month ago.  Initially she was accepting desk repairs from Skylife Academy but they were not paying on daily basis due to scarcity of Kenya shillings. When she was introduced to Sarafu, she liked the idea because the school  always supplement the Kenya shillings with sarafu. She is now having more customers and she is in a position to sell her excess capacity (firewood, bed, sofa sets and cabinets) using Sarafu.  Teachers have been buying beds, sofa sets and cabinets from her . Phostina also uses Sarafu to pay school fees for the daughter who studies in the nearest community (kangemi). She pays her workers in Sarafu also.

**Jackline Kasiva** has been a member of Sarafu network for the last 9 months. Initially she never had clients on daily basis since people don’t plait hair every day. She could end up spending a day or two without clients. Others who came with less money were not plaited since she preferred money for every service offered. When she joined Sarafu, she no longer sends her clients back with the little Kenya shillings that they bring, in fact she encourages them to supplement with Sarafu and she is able to plait them.  Sarafu has made her expand her business. She is also saving Kenya shillings whenever she spent Sarafu and now she is not only plaiting hair but she is also selling the hair products.

She was able to save Kenya shillings which she used to take her son to high school with it. She uses Sarafu to plait her hair and also get vegetables from her neighbour.

**Pastor Silvanous** joined Sarafu 3 years ago. He is the main pastor of Hope Gospel Center. The congregation pays their tithes and offerings to him in form of Sarafu. He uses the same amount to go back to the congregation to purchase basic needs. He has also rented the church to a school and in return he receives rent in Sarafu. The pastor told us that his congregants are happy to use Sarafu in his church (as Tithing/Sadaka) and he accepts it since he will still go back to the congregants to get his basic needs. He says that Sarafu has united them and as a church they have now started a savings scheme due to Sarafu.
