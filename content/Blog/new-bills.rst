We attended a meeting on `DOEN's New Economy program <http://www.doen.nl/what-we-do/green/new-economy.htm>`_, where our newest version of community currency bills were unveiled in Amsterdam. The new bills are printed in Germany on special paper provided by `STRO <http://www.socialtrade.nl/>`_. They are the most secure and advanced bills we've ever used!






These bills will go into circulation first in a rural area near Mombasa with up to 4000 farms, 10 schools and 30 local shops. They represent cooperative assets in the form of a maize mill as well as a community market place. The program is part of a Food Security measure. 



 



We were also honored to visit `TimeLab <http://timelab.org/>`_ in Ghent this month and also give a talk to like-minded people throughout Belglum.





Other news: In the Kawangware slum this month, more than 100 Dollars worth of Community Currency circulated among three schools providing schools fees for over 400 students.
