Here the Kaukuma community leaders traveled to Siaya to learn about how
Sarafu is used there and about community farming practices that Sarafu

best way to share.

This is the beginning of a new community farm in Siaya where the Kakuma
team was learning. The poster is showing the intention of the community
farm and soil regenerative practices that are being used. Below is a
testimonial of one of the farmers in Siaya that taught the Kakuma
refugees to follow their example to build a strong local economy.
