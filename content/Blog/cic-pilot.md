In the last 30 days we have had 3015 users making at least 1 trade. For
a volume of 2,336,655 Tokens (~23k USD equivalent of goods and services
traded) ... those 3015 users are holding 1,514,155 Tokens (~15k USD).
That would be a monthly velocity of ~1.54 (CIC Supply/Trade) (that is
3x higher! than current M2 USD velocity

reported quarterly)

Note that currently no one can cash out their reserve yet (still
building the software) -- instead Grassroots Economics (GE) is buying
tokens off the Groups accounts (groups of about 25 women who all run
businesses and save together). In that same period we have bought
387,715 Tokens (~3.8k USD)

- Currently → Trade / Cash-out-Cost = (~23k usd) / (~3.8k USD) is
  about 6x impact (as measured by increased purchasing power compared
  to Kenyan shillings).

Again note that currently users can't create their own CICs by adding
reserve to their particular group's CIC reserve nor can they cash out
that reserve. In the next stage we are no longer buying off CICs (but
rather users can cash out from their own reserves) and anyone (like a GE
as a donor) can also add more reserve to mint CICs. We can then talk
both amounts cashed out and cashed in (from/to reserves).

So in the (we hope very near) future there is an initial seed fund of
USD (DAI) going into reserve (which creates ~4x (leverage to) the
number of CIC tokens to reserve based on risk/ size of reserve) -- then
cashing out from that (burning CICs) and adding back to it (minting
CICs). See equations here:
<https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/enabling-leverage.html>

- Near Target → Trade / Cost = (~23k usd) / (~1.1k USD Cashed our
  minus cashed in) is about 20x impact.

For a fully resilient CIC the Cashing-out and Cashing-in are equal over
a time period (given adequate market size) -- hence the cashing-out
'cost' here goes to zero. Leaving the cost to support the initial seed
fund as well as maintain customer support/systems (Fixed costs of staff
and services).

- Future Target → Continuous Trade / (Once time cost + minimal support
  cost) = +100x
- Preliminary studies
  using eMoney suggest that if you compare 15k USD worth of CICs
  entering the network of ~3000 traders vs 15k USD worth of eMoney
  (MPESA) injected you get comparable trade volume (23k USD). The
  distinction is that with eMoney over 90% of it ends up outside the
  network in the same time period while with CICs it stays in local
  circulation -- only 25% (3.8k/15k) was turned into Mpesa (through GE
  purchases) and quickly leaves the community. Also important to note
  there that the 15k of CIC tokens were created with only 3.7k USD of
  collateral / reserve.

Hence, currently we are able to get the same volume of trade as Mpesa
with roughly 50% of the cost (3.7+3.8=7.6k USD) of injecting Mpesa
directly, while also assuring that the trade will be at least 75% in the
network. More effort to track cash and eMoney in these networks is
needed to properly compare. This would double the trade volume / impact,
based on the same donations given out of organizations like Give
Directly that do cash transfer (and ideally much more than double in
future iterations with more direct access to reserve).

Finally note that our method of initial distribution of CICs, in lieu
ofand eventually in addition to not yet being able to allow people to
create their own, is to give each new user 400 (~$4USD roughly the
cost of feeding a family of 5 for one day. Other distribution methods
being developed include redistributing a collective tax chosen by a
community, using a users connectivity to the network in different trade
categories (I.e.. supporting social services with democratic
participatory budgeting).
