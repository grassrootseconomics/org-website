**The Resilience of Mwethia**

In September 2024, the Grassroots Economics (GrE) team embarked on a journey back to Kitui to reconnect with the communities involved in the 2021-2022 pilot program with the World Food Programme (WFP). The project was a study which focused on Community Inclusion Currencies (CICs) and Syntropic Agroforestry (SAF), was initially designed as a six-month partnership, later extended to ten months. Now, two years after the pilot, it was time to see how the community groups were faring.

**A Thriving Community Model**

The gathering, hosted by Baraka group members at the homestead of Eliza Kavutha in Kasunguni sublocation, Zombe ward, was more than just a review of progress—it was a celebration of community strength and resilience. The Thome, a traditional council meeting among the Kamba people, provided a perfect platform for this. In attendance were representatives from all 14 groups across Kitui county, local leadership, chiefs and county government officials, and GrE’s team, including Antony Ngoka, Will and Nia Ruddick.

The day began with an activity central to their ecosystem restoration efforts: digging a 20-meter traditional Hügelkultur style trench filled with buried rotting wood, for water catchment. This simple, yet profound, act of mutual service, or mwethia (the Kamba version of the coastal Mweria), exemplified the strength of community labor and shared goals that the original pilot hoped to cultivate. Under the guidance of Aude Peronne, an ecosystem restoration and stewardship specialist, the group exchanged not only physical labor but valuable knowledge on soil and water conservation.

**Building Strong Foundations for the Future**

During the afternoon session, participants shared their experiences, successes, and challenges. Baraka, one of the most active groups, attributed their success to a strong internal constitution that included fines for late meetings and missed appointments, ensuring accountability among members. The group emphasized how their weekly mwethia gatherings helped them achieve significant milestones—from providing each member with a chicken to starting a brick-making initiative aimed at providing each family with goats.

The group's Mwethia as well as local market transactions, are visible on the [Sarafu.Network](https://sarafu.network/vouchers/0x4CAE7279ad92A719Ff2f126B706ee61D85f91eA4), reflect a vibrant community economy where mutual support and resource coordination flourish. This network, made possible through the Commitment Pooling Protocol pioneered by Grassroots Economics, allows communities like Baraka to formalize their commitments through Community Asset Vouchers (CAVs)​ and connect them among each other across the county​. These vouchers serve not only as a medium of exchange but as a testament to the power of collective commitments, a modern evolution of the age-old traditions like Mwethia.


Since starting this pilot with WFP using the Celo Blockchain we've seen:

* 485 pool swaps (cross exchange between vouchers)
* 2872 active user accounts. 
* 74 pool deposits (Seeding commitment pools)
* 144,558 voucher transfers (User to user exchanges)
* 278 mints (These are for creating vouchers)
* 5,138 Celo faucet gives (Enabeling anyone to use Celo with no charges via USSD/SMS)

**The Mwethia Tradition: A Pillar of Sustainability**

At the heart of this resilience is Mwethia, a traditional labor-sharing practice that continues to provide a strong foundation for these groups. Mwethia is not just about labor; it is about commitment, trust, and the pooling of resources for the betterment of the community​. This tradition, combined with the innovative use of digital currencies and vouchers, enables these communities to manage their resources more effectively and sustainably.

The strength of these groups lies in their ability to blend tradition with innovation. While modern tools like Sarafu and CAVs enable greater efficiency and broader reach, it is the ancient practice of Mwethia that continues to unite these communities and drive their success. As the Baraka group looks to expand into goat stewardship, they embody the vision of community-driven growth that the WFP pilot initiatives hoped to inspire.

Note that the norm in many humanitarian projects is that they stop completely after the intervention. We found something different. By focusing on traditional mutual service and rotating labor organizations locally called Mwethia - we found that the communities only needed support in restarting these ancient practices.This program was originally a study with control groups where there was no intervention, now all these group are following the example of the treatment groups.

**What’s Next?**

Two years after the pilot, the Kitui groups are thriving and growing. The bonds they have forged through Mwethia are strong, and their future plans—expanding agroforestry, increasing livestock, and enhancing community savings—speak to the sustainability of the model. These communities have demonstrated that when resource coordination is rooted in both tradition, digital accountability and interoperability between groups, it can lead to long-term, self-sustaining growth.

For Grassroots Economics, this visit reaffirmed the power of commitment pooling and the importance of supporting communities as they take ownership of their future. The journey from pilot to long term community practice is not without its challenges, but the resilience of the Kitui groups provides a clear answer to the question of what happens after seeding such pilots: growth, sustainability, and collective well-being.
