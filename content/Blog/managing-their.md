Laurence and his brother together run the Blues Hotel - a small take
away restaurant specializing in delicious chapati. Anyone in Mukuru
Kayaba's Kambi Moto village can come buy food there using Sarafu (a
Community Inclusion Currency (CIC) - 400 Sarafu (USD $4) as well as a
basic income is given freely to community members as part of a Red Cross
initiative to support local economies during crisis)

Over the last 1 month they have had 268 clients come buy over $3,000
USD worth of their cooked food! What makes it even more amazing is that
they have spent an equivalent of $2,600 USD of Sarafu to purchase
cooking oil, fuel and wheat flour for their business. Circular economy -
circular chapati!

Vincent and his mother have used Sarafu for the past 8 months providing
different delicacies to the people of Mukuru Kayaba. They have decided
to support their community in Mukuru by accepting Sarafu from any
customer and also they spend their CIC by buying wheat flour,beans and
other products from different outlets.

Over the last month they have had 123 customers and sold $840 USD by
accepting Sarafu when Kenyan Shillings is scarce and they have spent
roughly the same amount on their own basic needs - creating and
maintaining a circular economy.

Susan is a mother and tailor in Mukuru. She was started using CICs 2
months ago and she also registered her Women's Savings Group into the
network. Susan and the group members work tirelessly in order to provide
masks to people in her community by selling them using Sarafu. She uses
the currency to purchase food for her family and also save some in the
group since national currency is scarce at the moment.

In the last month Sarah has sold $756 USD worth of masks to over 100
people. Need a mask? Talk to Susan!

This guy is amazing! Victor joined the network of Sarafu users 2 months
ago. He is in the jua kali sector and very popular in his area for
making metalic doors, desks and even jiko (ovens). He accepts Sarafu in
his business since he can as well spend it in order to get food for his
family. His business had been stuck due to covid 19 but when he joined
Sarafu, customers started coming as they wanted some study desks and
metallic doors for their homes and businesses.

Victor in the last month has had 54 clients and sold $1,246 USD worth
of his services using Sarafu

Grace is one of the Red Cross' disaster response team members and is
also a caring mother. She has a cereal shop in Mukuru and she feeds more
than a hundred households. She joined the network 8 months ago and in
this time of the pandemic, she has dedicated her shop to feed even more
families by use of the CIC (Sarafu). She has increased her trade volume
in order to help families get a meal. In return, Gertrude also spends
more of her Sarafu in the community and by doing so, she is able to save
the national currency which she uses to buy more stock for her shop.

Grace has given out $2,286 USD worth of food to 114 community members
this month using Sarafu and has spent $2,316 USD on restocking and her
family basic needs. She is a powerhouse making her community thrive
during crisis and charting a path toward a resilient economic recovery.
