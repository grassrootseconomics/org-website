We attended a meeting on [DOEN's New Economy
program](http://www.doen.nl/what-we-do/green/new-economy.htm), where our
newest version of community currency bills were unveiled in Amsterdam.
The new bills are printed in Germany on special paper provided by
[STRO](http://www.socialtrade.nl/). They are the most secure and
advanced bills we've ever used!

These bills will go into circulation first in a rural area near Mombasa
with up to 4000 farms, 10 schools and 30 local shops. They represent
cooperative assets in the form of a maize mill as well as a community
market place. The program is part of a Food Security measure.

We were also honored to visit [TimeLab](http://timelab.org/) in Ghent
this month and also give a talk to like-minded people throughout
Belglum.

Other news: In the Kawangware slum this month, more than 100 Dollars
worth of Community Currency circulated among three schools providing
schools fees for over 400 students.
