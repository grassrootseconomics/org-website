The Kwa Ng'ombe Business Network held their 1st Market day on the 24th
October 2015. Members came to sell and trade their goods at the event
using Ng'ombeni-Pesa and over 50 people from the community who were
allowed to purchase some of the community fund in Ng'ombeni-Pesa at a
discount. The Kenyan Shillings generated by the event were distributed
to the vendors and the community fund replenished. 7 new businesses
registered at the event hosted at a local school, and the network
continues to grow with the hope of reaching 200 members.

Halima Hassan from Ng'ombeni Pesa Business Network is shown to the left.
She sells cooked food (chapatti, beans, potatoes and Bhajias). "I'm
very happy to use Ng'ombeni pesa and today I sold the most within a
short period of time compared to any other day." She says, "I am happy
today because my potatoes are almost through, yet I have been here for
less than one hour. I wish everyday was a market day so that non-members
get the chance of buying with our community currency".
