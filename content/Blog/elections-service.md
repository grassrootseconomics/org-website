New Board and Community Service Contributions

On April 19th the Bangladesh Business Network had their first official
board elections and ratified their statues. They also voted on the use
of their community funds. When each member is registered to join the
network they receive 200 Bangla-Pesa and another 200 Bangla-Pesa is
added to the community fund backed by their goods and services. The
community fund consists of each 170 members dues of 200 Bangla-Pesa each
minus those used for administrative purposes -- such as networking
exercises.

Community funds were given to both environmental and health
organizations in the community. A community environmental and waste
collection team was awarded 2,000 Bangla-Pesa as was a group of
Community Heath Workers. These funds will be used by the members of
those groups to purchase goods and services at the shops of the network
members. This way the network is helping to support their community
through their own goods and services.

Networking

Our networking team led by Alfred Sigo has been working to knit the
community businesses together. Beyond having a means of exchange to
trade among each other there is a lot of work to make sure there is a
thriving market in which everyone is aware of each others' offers and
wants. In a more efficient market less and less currency is needed to
facilitate daily trade. For this purpose we continue to visit each
member of the network and connect them with new customers. We've been
slowly generating the following map of businesses in the community --
once it is done we will create a sign board to help people know where to
use their Bangla-Pesa.

Kangemi-Pesa? -- Nairobi

Last week Will Ruddick was invited to Kangemi, an informal settlement in
Nairobi, where a group of local schools together with Nyendo-Learning
Hand in Hand are taking their first steps in replicating the Bangla-Pesa
program. We are excited to see another community benefit from enabling
themselves to issue and manage their own community currency. We are also
happy to be talking with professors of economics from the University of
Nairobi on studying these programs.
