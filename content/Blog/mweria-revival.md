Grassroots Economics Foundation is excited to unveil **"Mweria Revival,"** a Participatory Video created by local Kilifi and Kwale community members Kenya. This video, developed with the training and support of InsightShare, highlights the rich tradition of **Mweria**â€”a Rotating Labor Association practiced by the Mijikenda people and similar to customs seen in many indigenous cultures worldwide.

**Mweria** fosters mutual support and community solidarity, and this video beautifully showcases how the community has revived this ancestral practice. It depicts real-life scenes of communal farming, collective problem-solving, and the joyous spirit of working together, reaffirming that Mweria is not just a tradition but a vital part of their daily lives.
