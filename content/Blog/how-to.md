**Vulnerable Household Support Networks (VHSNs)** _In this post I'll
describe a modality for social support and humanitarian aid such as cash
transfer programming utilizing Community Inclusion Currencies (CICs)._

**Vulnerable households (VHHs)**

VHHs in an area are identified via survey carried out by enumerators
that seeks to understand which families in the community are most
vulnerable and need support. Generally they are families where the head
of household is a youth, elderly or very ill. [See how Kenyan Red Cross
works hard to identify vulnerable
households.](https://www.redcross.or.ke/component/search/?searchword=vulnerable&searchphrase=all&Itemid=0).

_Utilizing and developing Community Inclusion Currencies (CICs) can
support, strengthen and identify social safety nets around vulnerable
households._

A Community Inclusion Currency (CIC) like
[Sarafu](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/sarafu-network) is created
and/or distributed regularly (similar to a basic income) in the area to
VHHs as well as to all the households in the community in order to
enable them to record mutual support among each other. Community members
are asked to support the vulnerable families and each other with goods
and services, using a CIC to record the support given.

For instance: a woman named Rehema who sells tomatoes may offer some
tomatoes worth 20 KSH to a VHH. The VHH can record and show their
appreciation by sending Rehema 20 CIC tokens using her feature phone. -
Rehema can now also appreciate her own friends family and even tomato
suppliers by sending them CIC in return for their support, goods and
services.

**Vulnerable Household Support Network Members (NMs):**

those people that support the VHH by offering goods and services are
traditionally not easy to objectively identify or quantify. By receiving
a CIC a NM can record of their support in the whole community and around
VHHs. This data is recorded securely and anonymously on a blockchain.
Those NMs in the community that wish to share their blockchain address
can be identified and capacity built / rewarded / supported by
individual cash transfers.

**Vulnerable Household Support Network - Identification:**

Each user in the network has a unique address for their account on the
blockchain that can be used to record every single CIC transaction. Any
CIC transaction coming from a VHH can be viewed and audited as a record
of support being offered to that VHH from members of the VHS-N.

For instance a VHH uses their feature phone and sends 100 CIC to
appreciate Rehema the sender and record her offer of 100 KSH worth of
maize flour as support.

That gives us a way to measure and rank how much support Rehema has
offered. Indeed we can see the whole network of users that have offered
VHHs support. If we look at this whole network we can get a sum of all
the support a person like Rehema has offered to ANY vulnerable household

- and we can even rank her support for VHHs among ALL the NMs (who are
  CIC users).

Say that Rehema's amount of received CIC from VHHs (measuring her offers
of maize flour) makes her in the top percentile of network members; Here
in the example below we can see that she gave 46% of the total support
in the community to a VHH.

NM names Support/month percentage

---

Rehema Katans 3000 CIC 46%

Fran Miguu 2000 CIC 31%

Katana Busia 1000 CIC 15%

Gertrude Mia 550 CIC 8%

Total 6550 CIC 100%

: stats

The four people or businesses have received 6550 CICs over a month
because of the support they offered to vulnerable households. They can
choose to offer their information to the public or an aid organization
in order to be recognized and potentially rewarded.

**Vulnerable Household Support Networks (VHSNs) can identified using
Community Inclusion Currency (CIC) transaction data and give aid
organizations concrete and auditable proof of community support
(POCS).**

In this way **ANYONE** offering support, goods or services to Vulnerable
Households can be identified, acknowledged, rewarded to build their
capacity. Because these CICs can continue circulating in the community
as long as they are needed they can provide a long term community safety
net, especially when Kenyan shillings are scarce or during or recovering
from a crisis like COVID.

Note that there are MANY other ways to define and identify CSNs:
Including voting systems as well as identifying specific areas of
support, such as: farming, education or food and water.
