**How do you have a proper checkers tournament when no one can pay the
entry fees?**

Jacob the organizer saw an opportunity. His neighbors in several rural
villages are in the worst time of the year because of the scarcity of
Kenyan Shillings. Instead of shillings they are using their phones to
exchange blockchain tokens (Community Inclusion Currencies) for basic
needs. Jacob figured the many checkers (draft/draughts) players (a local
tradition) who would be willing to pay an entry fee with those tokens
which could be used as a reward for the top three players - and he was
right!

After dozens of dramatic checkers matches the top three players emerged
victorious and won 5000, 3000 and 2000 Sarafu respectively. Their main
goal when asked what they would do with their winnings: employ their
neighbors to assist in farming their lands and stocking their businesses
with local produce like flour, casava, peanuts and coconuts.

Everyone wins! Checkers prowess is rewarded, youth are encouraged to
learn the game and the winners can employ their neighbors for farming
and buy local goods and services with Community Inclusion Currencies.
This is one of many community activities, including collective farming,
religious gatherings, that are being revitalized using a local medium of
exchange and removing money scarcity.
