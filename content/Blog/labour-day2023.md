In Kenya, Labour Day is celebrated on May 1st, just like in many other countries. It is also referred to as International Workers' Day or May Day. The origins of Labour Day in Kenya can be traced back to the broader international labor movement, which began advocating for better working conditions, fair wages, and an eight-hour workday in the late 19th century. The labor movement in Kenya has played a crucial role in the country's struggle for independence and continues to advocate for the rights and welfare of workers.

Labour Day has long been a day to honor workers' achievements and contributions, as well as to acknowledge the importance of the 8-hour workweek. Organizations like the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the Knights of Labor were instrumental in advocating for workers' rights and better working conditions. However, their efforts were made within the confines of the capitalist employer-employee relationship, often referred to as "wage slavery."

To truly achieve freedom and autonomy for all, we must transcend this capitalist paradigm and shift towards a model of mutual service and cooperation. Mutual service is based on the principle of Non-Dominance, meaning no person or association should have dominant rights over another's resources, such as data, finances, intellect, materials, and freedom. In a world where service is prioritized over commodified labor, we would transition from employer-employee relationships to networks of mutual service agreements. These agreements would allow individuals and groups to collaborate freely and equitably, creating a more inclusive and just economic system.

This mutual service approach aligns with the principles of an economic commons, emphasizing shared ownership, cooperation, and stewardship of resources. The commons model also incorporates Ostrom's 8 principles, derived from Indigenous practices of commons management, and a holistic and integral community asset framework, covering Human/Spiritual, Physical, Natural, Political, Social, and Economic aspects of well-being. Embracing these principles can pave the way for a more sustainable, resilient, and empowering economic system.

A critical component of mutual services is the use of indigenous mutual credit systems. Instead of relying on capitalistic financial systems, mutual credit enables individuals and communities to exchange goods and services based on trust and reciprocity. This fosters a more equitable distribution of resources and empowers communities to be more self-reliant and less dependent on external markets.

Technological advancements, such as mesh networks, microgrids, and distributed ledger systems, can play a significant role in facilitating the transition to mutual service networks. These technologies enable decentralized, community-driven resource coordination, allowing people to collaborate and share resources more efficiently and equitably.

Instead of fighting for workers' rights within the existing capitalistic, dominating employer-employee paradigm, we must learn from and build networks of mutual service to shape the future we all want to live in.

Let's reimagine Labour Day as Mutual Service Day, a celebration of the potential for a more equitable, cooperative, and empowering economic system in Kenya. By embracing mutual service agreements, credit systems, and the principles of the economic commons, we can create a world where resources are shared, communities are empowered, and the bonds of wage slavery are finally broken. It's time to start building networks of mutual service and create a future full of wellness.
