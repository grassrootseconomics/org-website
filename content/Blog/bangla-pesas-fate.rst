We are still being charged with forgery under penal code 367(e). For Kenyan Laws see `page 121 <http://www.kenyalaw.org/klr/fileadmin/pdfdownloads/Acts/PenalCodeCap63.pdf>`_.




On July 15th - the Kenyan Dirctor of Public Prosecutions, `Keriako Tobiko <http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/government/attoneyG.htm>`_ recalled our case file and hence the trial was not allowed to proceed.




Apparently this was due to a large amount of interest in the case and a recent `petition <http://grassrootseconomics.org/petition>`_ . More in the `news <http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/DPP-recalls-case-against-Bangla-Pesa-informal-currency/-/539546/1917800/-/949nai/-/index.html>`_




So we are currently praying for a positive verdict from Keriako Tobiko so that these programs can continue.
