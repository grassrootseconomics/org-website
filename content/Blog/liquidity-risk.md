We're very happy to start the year with a visit from our Director of
Risk Management Jimmy Heyns from Belgium with over 18 years of
international experience in the Financial Industry. As our community
currencies move more and more toward cooperative toolsets for creating
liquidity based on assets, we've been seeking to have a stronger and
stronger credit policy.

As of 2016 there are thousands Complementary Currency Programs
worldwide. Given this is still an unregulated industry the collateral
requirements of the organization issuing community currency don't
really exist. In the worst cases organizations can issue much more
credit than they have any tangible backing for.

- Generally all this credit ends up at the most popular shops
- Those shops stops accepting it because they can't use it fast
  enough.
- Other shops start to default -- causing a chain reaction (reputation
  risk).
- If everyone then wants to cash out -- there isn't even enough euros
  (collateral) to satisfy them. This is basic Liquidity Risk. The
  organization is acting like an unregulated bank and issuing tons of
  uncollateralized credit to consumers.

If a community currency is being used in a commercial business -- there
must be some assurance that, that business won't get stuck with too
much community currency. In the simulation there are enough cascading
defaults that there is a critical system failure. Essentially the
currency was a bubble that could not be sustained. This is bad for
businesses and the economy at large.

When we first started we used mutual guarantee. Where members would back
other members. And disputes were moderated. This was great at small
scale but hard to implement for more than 100 business. So what we did
was being to create cooperative businesses that were the liquid and
asset collateral basis for the community currency.

So what do we recommend?

- First that all currency is backed fully in cooperatively owned
  liquid and physical assets. This means creating cooperative
  businesses in these communities that offer security for the
  currency.
- Second we allow for a steam release valve - which we call
  Credit-clearing. If you keep adding heat to a system -- it gets too
  hot and needs a way to cool off -- or it will explode. If business
  such as schools collect too much currency over a short period of
  time, we give them a way to exchange for national currency or other
  assets that the cooperative keeps as collateral.
- The amount of liquid (cash) collateral vs Asset collateral (stock or
  other assets) that needs to be kept on hand for credit-clearing is
  based on a risk analysis. We're lucky to have a risk manager on our
  board that can set our standards higher than those of the banking
  industry.
