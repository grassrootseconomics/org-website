A municipality, town or local administration is an ideal issuer and
anchor for a basic/guaranteed income because the have the means to back
it and the intention to build sustainable and thriving local markets--
Such a Municipal Basic Income (MBI) can in turn act as a growth medium
and network token for Community Inclusion Currencies which allow local
groups and businesses to form strong local markets through the MBI
network.

In its simplest form a municipality creates a token which is distributed
to residents and local projects -- and taxed and redistributed as a
basic income for those active in the network. This MBI would be backed
by the holding tax itself and as well local services offered by the
municipality (like 50% off public transport or health services). This is
similar to Sarafu in Kenya whose supply is set by the target population
-- taxed and redistributed. The tax and redistribution incentivizes
trade and discourages hoarding.

Businesses and groups of residents can create a Community Inclusion
Currency against their production (like a voucher) and offer some of
these CICs in exchange for the MBI -- in order to support the
municipality. **This is a measurable form of corporate social
responsibility (CSR) and social enterprise.**

This allows business and communities to transparently and measurably
connect their vouchers to the greater social service network formed by
the MBI. Online marketplace could feature these supporting businesses as
a way to drive traffic to them.

The initial supply and taxes collected from holding fees on balances of
the MBI could also be used to aid community support networks and for
local programs like Food Forests.

A municipality creating such a MBI would have to create a contract
against its redemption as well as taxation and redistribution. This
contract could be voted on signed and scanned as a pdf and fixed to the
MBI token on a blockchain (low-tech).

Supporting business could in turn create their own CIC as a claim
against their production (again in a signed contract) and place those
CICs into liquidity pools that contain both their contribution of CIC
(vouchers) and an amount of the MBI in order to enable traceable
exchange between the two.

This means that people could keep their municipality economies thriving
by accepting and trading a MBI which can be exchanged in limited amounts
for business vouchers (ala liquidity pools with CICs)

While in Kenya we rely on Humanitarian organizations to supply a basic
income token - a municipality, or local administration would be a
wonderful anchor for community health in this way. The possibilities of
MBIs combined with CICs are profound and life affirming. **Consider the
value in decentralized, municipally supported economies (networks of
MBIs) - building and supporting local as well as regional or National
economies.**
