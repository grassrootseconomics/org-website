Business development using community currency

Being a business development coordinator whose main objective is to see
communities' assets put into good use, I do feel motivated and inspired
when I see retailers at one of our communities in Gatina, Nairobi
seeking consultation from us on how best to use their savings and what
type of investments to undertake. Currently, small business traders
participating in the Sarafu-Credit community currency program are saving
KES 50/week (Merry-go-round) and the lump sum weekly payments being
strictly used for business purposes. The traders also under their own
accord save an additional KES 200/month that they intend to use for
business improvement with the help and training offered by Grassroots
Economics. These community currency traders come up with various
initiatives to see their businesses thrive and make my work in asset
development quite enjoyable as we seek to build thriving communities
with absolute support from the community members.

It's quite a motivating factor when traders at Gatina, one of our
communities participate in programs to increase circulation of
Sarafu-Credit as they have noticed that by accepting and using
Sarafu-Credit, their volumes of trade get to increase. Just to give an
example, a grocery trader called mama Desty who decided to trade using
Sarafu-Credit less than a month ago has been excited by the progress she
has made in terms of trade volumes - to the point of regretting why she
didn't get to join earlier. This type of excitement from traders,
increasing trade volumes and trust among community members have been key
reasons why our office at Kawangware has been receiving requests from
neighboring communities to have the program expanded to cover them.
