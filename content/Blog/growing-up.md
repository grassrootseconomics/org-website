Growing up is hard. It's especially hard if you're living on the streets
in Mombasa, or if your misbehavior in your community led to your
short-term imprisonment in a correctional facility. These are the
children with which we work through the MotoMoto program. Although the
children and youth from the streets and the youth from the correctional
facility have very different pasts and experiences, they are still
responding to our methodology in similarly positive ways.

Who They Are

The table below contains a summary of basic characteristics of MotoMoto
participants separated by type of participant (from the streets or from
the Borstal). The average age is very similar, around 18 years old. All
the children in the Borstal are male by necessity, but most of the
children (all but 2) from the streets are also male. However, those in
the Borstal have much more education than those in the streets, having
completed at least primary school on average. Prior to entering the
Borstal, most of these boys were also living with and being supported by
their parents. Those children from the streets, in contrast, were living
without parents and supporting themselves primarily by begging,
hustling, and garbage collection.

What They Need

These different life experiences have led the youth from the streets and
those from the Borstal to have very different needs. Those in the
Borstal often need help with psycho-emotional issues and pursuing
further education. Addressing psycho-emotional issues and facilitating
access to future education will ensure they can reintegrate with their
families and pursue meaningful employment after their incarceration. In
contrast, the children from the streets most often cite substance abuse
treatment and employment skills as key needs, seeking practical skills
to maintain themselves on the streets.

In response to these unique needs, our life skills counselor has focused
on providing psycho-emotional tools to deal with these differing
challenges. In the Borstal, we focus on teaching self-awareness and
positive decision-making skills, so youth, who were mostly incarcerated
for petty theft and under-aged sex, can identify their emotional state
and make good decisions despite how they feel. On the streets, we focus
on why youth use drugs, how it affects them, and how to stop.

How They've Progressed

On the streets, the youth population is unstable and transitory, they
disappear for months only to return and resume training with the Poi and
life skills. For that reason, even though the Borstal sessions were
added later, those boys have attended almost as many sessions as those
on the streets. Not surprisingly, the boys from the Borstal are also
rapidly catching up in terms of their Poi skill level, with most being
intermediate level (like the street youth) in common tricks like
helicopter, weave, and backward weave. Both the Borstal boys and the
street children have a meaningful understanding of life skills related
to identifying common needs and challenges facing themselves (and youth
in general), as well as self-esteem and decision-making. Some of the
street youth are already engaging in behavior change, stopping their
drug use during class, at least. Further, some in the Borstal are
actively expressing more positive attitudes toward themselves and their
futures.
