We are very happy to announce that today, for the first time in our organizational history, the community currency members of the Nairobi programs registered themselves as a cooperative: The Sarafu Cooperative.



 



We started these 3 groups back in 2015 in Kibera, Kangemi and Kawangware, and we are very proud to see that they have successfully come together to form a powerful cooperative which will preside over 2 wholesale markets and 3 community currency networks.

Today was their first official meeting and the handing over of their registration certificate. We look forward to continue to capacity build them and support them throughout this process. It is extremely exciting to see cooperatives utilizing community currencies for economic resilience, sustainability, marketing, regional development, food security and community cohesion!
