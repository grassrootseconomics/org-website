                    <li>Holding fees (in Sarafu) encourage users to spend their Sarafu. These fees then supply further funding for basic income in Sarafu.</li>
                    <li>Humanitarian orgs use Sarafu trade data to identify weak spots for capacity building.</li>

                <li>Develop web-based non-custodial systems (wallets and token creation interfaces)</li>
                <li>Document and enable more interoperability with other protocols, APIs chat bots, market places</li>
                <li>Develop Voting systems for governance and tax (demurrage) redistribution</li>
                <li>Develop Standard Operating Procedures for humanitarian organizations.</li>
                <li>Develop different reserve pools (network tokens (Sarafu), stable tokens, carbon credits).</li>
                <li>Develop parametric triggers for aid injection</li>
                <li>Develop an SDG Impact Index related to CIC transaction data (categories, gender .. )</li>
