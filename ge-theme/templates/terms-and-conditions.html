        <strong class="pt-3">1. NATURE OF THE PARTIES</strong>
        <p class="pt-3">An organization or individual applies for an audit and verification with GEF. This applicant is hereinafter referred to as Client. By using Sarafu-Credit in paper form or digitally through sarafu.network the, Client agrees to abide by these Trading Procedures Policies Rules and Regulations contained herein. SC Trading Network acts as a facilitator for the development of a trading network and auditor of all vouchers issued to the client. Client is an individual or legal entity that willingly uses the SC Trading Network to trade its goods and or services among its members and wishes to be issued vouchers to facilitate barter trade exchange services.</p>

        <strong class="pt-3">2.  NATURE OF SC VOUCHERS and TOKENS</strong>
        <p class="pt-3">A ‘trade’ is a purchase or sale of goods and or services whereby payment is made via barter using SC Vouchers or Tokens pursuant to the terms contained in this Agreement. A SC Voucher or Token is an accounting unit used to record the value of a trade –SC as well as each Token has a viable exchange rate to Kenyan Shillings at the time of trade. Ownership of SC or Tokens on SC Network denotes the acceptance of a gift and no right to receive goods or services available within the SC Trading Network Marketplace. SC may be used only in the manner and for the purpose set forth in this Agreement; SC will not be considered legal tender, securities or commodities and may not be redeemed for Kenyan Shillings. SC Trading Network disclaims responsibility for the negotiability of SC or for the availability of goods and services from any source. SC physical printed vouchers are issued with an expiration date or maturity period called the term. At the end of the term SC has no redeemable value for barter exchanges. All SC in any Client account will be subject to an automatic holding tax on a weekly or monthly basis.</p>

        <strong class="pt-3"> 3.  STANDARDS AND TRANSPARENCY</strong>
        <p class="pt-3">As a responsible third party record keeper and auditor, SC Trading Network facilitates the development and operation of peer-to-peer Client's mutual-credit clearing systems. Each client is audited for the number of members that qualify for a SC Voucher allotment. This verification process involves a questionnaire and the establishment of local guarantors for the new Client member. The amount of SC Vouchers allocated to the Client depends on the size and types of members therin. The vouchers issued are to be used as the vouchers of each businesses among the client.</p>

        <strong class="pt-3">4.  TRADE COORDINATING FUNCTION</strong>
        <p class="pt-3">SC Trading Network serves in a trade coordinating capacity in organizing and facilitating trade among Clients and members of Clients. Responsibility for the conduct of a trade is exclusively that of the Clients and members of the Client participating in the trade. The duty to inspect goods for quality and quantity and fitness for purpose, to evaluate the quality of services, or to obtain or act upon any warranty rests upon the buyer Client. SC Trading Network will use its best efforts to broker the Client’s SC into goods and services, to accurately record trades, and to administer Client agreements and trading rules in accordance with their terms. However, Client acknowledges that the sole principals in any trades are the buying and selling Clients involved, that the trades are entered into voluntarily and that SC Trading Network is not the guarantor of any product, service or token. SC Vouchers are ultimately and fully backed by the assets, goods and services of the Client.</p>

        <strong class="pt-3">5.  EXCHANGE PARTICIPATION</strong>
        <p class="pt-3"></p>SC Trading Network or its owner entities may maintain an account in the system and transact business through the network and agree to abide by the same terms and conditions of all Clients.

        <p class="pt-3">SC Trading Network shall use its best efforts to solicit new businesses as Clients, having goods or services to satisfy the needs of all Clients. Because of high Client demand and short supply, certain items may be available on a limited basis only (i.e., appliances, TVs, furniture, airline tickets, tires, computers, cameras, lumber, etc.). SC Trading Network is committed to showing availability of those products or services actually available in the exchange system.</p>

        <strong class="pt-3"> 7.  DEFINITION OF CLIENT IN GOOD STANDING</strong>
        <p class="pt-3">A Client and all client members who conduct trades in accordance with this agreement, is current in any monies owing to SC Trading Network, and has a valid unexpired SC Vouchers, is considered, a ‘Client in good standing’.

Where a Client has by his or her conduct or misconduct displayed to SC Trading Network inability to meet the standards set in Client’s own industry relative to the quality of goods or services, or has been charged with the commission of a crime involving fraud or moral turpitude, or otherwise exhibits to SC Trading Network that Client’s reputation in the business community has been diminished, then for the protection of the remaining Clients, GEF reserves the right to terminate said Client’s account or restrict the rights of said Client to sell or advertise Client’s goods or services for sale until such time said Client can exhibit to SC Trading Network that the standard expected in Client’s own industry can be met.</p>

        <strong class="pt-3">18.  TERMINATION</strong>
        <p class="pt-3">Either party may terminate this agreement, with or without cause, upon ten (10) days written notice to the other party. Upon termination, all cash and trade credit service fees outstanding become due and payable; transaction fees are non-refundable. If Client has a negative SC balance (purchases exceed sales) at the time of termination, Client must balance the account with trade credit within thirty (30) days of the termination date. If any negative trade balance remains after the thirty (30) day period, Client shall immediately pay SC Trading Network any remaining balance in cash.

        <strong class="pt-3">21.  DISPUTES AND ARBITRATION</strong>

        <strong class="pt-3">22.  ENFORCEMENT</strong>
        <p class="pt-3">Each and every term and provision and every last term and provision contained in these Trading Procedures, Policies, Rules and Regulations is severable from every other term and provision therein. If any such term or provision shall be judged invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of the remainder of any other term or provision of these Trading Rules and Regulations. The remainder shall remain valid, legal and enforceable and in full force and effect.

        <strong class="pt-3">24.  SPECIAL TRADE PROCEDURES</strong>

        <strong class="pt-3"> 25.  CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE</strong>
        <p class="pt-3">Client acknowledges that, as a Client of the SC Trading Network, it will have access to information and materials that are confidential and proprietary to SC Trading Network or other Clients of the network. Client agrees not to disclose information about the credit-clearing software, Client account data, Client contact data, Clients list or Clients’ email addresses to any person or entity except to other Clients or those specifically authorized by SC Trading Network to have access to this information. Client also agrees to take reasonable precautions to safeguard the confidentiality and security of such information.</p>

        <p class="pt-3">If this application is accepted and an account is opened for the Client in SC Trading Network, the Client and the individual signing for the Client hereby assume joint and separate responsibility for all purchases and fees as outlined in this agreement.</p>

        <strong class="pt-3">27.  DISSOLUTION</strong>
        <p class="pt-3">In the event that SC Trading Network terminates or otherwise ceases to do business, all Clients in a negative trade position will pay amounts they owe in cash (one trade Voucher being equal to one Kenyan Shillings) into a fund. The fund, less expenses, plus any SC Trading Network inventory will be distributed pro rata to all Clients who are in a positive trade position. Thus, all Clients in a positive position will receive cash and/or goods for their trade dollars to the extent that the funds permit. SC Trading Network shall not be liable to any Client’s cash or trade Vouchers beyond the distribution of such funds as aforesaid. Cessation of the SC Trading Network’s operations does not release any Client from liability to make any payment due to SC Trading Network at the time the SC Trading Network ’s operations cease.</p>

        <strong class="pt-3"> 28.  LAW</strong>

        <p class="pt-3">In the event of any legal disputes arising from these Trading Procedures, Policies, Rules and Regulations the Laws of Kenya shall apply. All transactions using SC Vouchers should be considered as barter trade.</p>
        <p class="pt-3">1. Central Bank of Kenya Act Cap 491 - S.21 states that : "All monetary obligations or transactions entered into or made in Kenya shall be deemed to be expressed and recorded, and shall be settled, in Kenya currency unless otherwise provided for by law or agreed upon between the parties"

                            The highlighted part in section 21 above gives parties in a transaction the leeway to decide what "currency" to use when transacting Consequently , it is my belief that one can chose to use Kenyan currency , Foreign currency or barter for goods /services so long as the parties are in agreement</p>
        <p class="pt-3">2. Interpretation and General Provisions Act Cap 2 - S.3: This Act defines the word sell as follows : “sell” includes barter, exchange and offer to sell or expose for sale.."</p>
        <p class="pt-3">From this and other statutes examined , barter trade is envisaged as part of normal trading .i.e. a normal buying and selling transaction in the Kenyan market.</p>
        <strong class="pt-3">None of the Statutes reviewed expressly prohibits or deems barter trade as an illegal activity</strong>
        <p class="pt-3">Conclusion: Barter Trade is a legal method of transacting between parties . In my view therefore, an illegality will only arise where the Foundation attempts to counterfeit currency - which is an offence with very steep penalties under Kenyan law ( See Penal Code - Cap 63). Also note that usage of Bangla-Pesa an example SC Voucher was deemed legal haven't not violated any laws under the CBK or KRA act by the office of the D.P.P. See his comments <a href="{{SITEURL}}/theme/pdfs/office-of-director.pdf">here.</a></p>

        <strong class="pt-3"> 29.  CLIENT ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND WARRANTY</strong>
        <p class="pt-3">Client acknowledges that they have read the currently effective Trading Procedures, Policies, Rules and Regulations, and that such Rules and Regulations may be changed by SC Trading Network from time to time in accordance with these Trading Procedures, Policies, Rules and Regulations. Client warrants that it provided all information to SC Trading Network in good faith and that such information is accurate to the best of its knowledge.</p>

        <strong class="pt-3"> 30. COMMITMENTS AND REPRESENTATIONS</strong>
        <p class="pt-3">SC Trading Network is only responsible for any commitments and representations made in writing by a duly authorized officer. Brokers, agents, or employees of SC Trading Network have no right to bind SC Trading Network to any obligation or representation whatsoever without such written authorization.</p>
