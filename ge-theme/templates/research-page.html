                <p class="re-small-font">The humanitarian sector has gone through a major shift toward injection of cash into vulnerable communities as its core modality. On this trajectory toward direct currency injection, something new has happened: namely the empowerment of communities to create their own local currencies, a tool known as Complementary Currency systems. This study mobilizes the concepts of endogenous regional development, import substitution and local market linkages as elaborated by Albert Hirschman and Jane Jacobs, to analyze the impact of a group of Complementary Currencies instituted by Grassroots Economics Foundation and the Red Cross in Kenya. The paper discusses humanitarian Cash and Voucher Assistance programs and compares them to a Complementary Currency system using Grassroots Economics as a case study. Transaction histories recorded on a blockchain and network visualizations show the ability of these Complementary Currencies to create diverse production capacity, dense local supply chains, and data for measuring the impact of humanitarian currency transfers. Since Complementary Currency systems prioritize both cooperation and localization, the paper argues that Complementary Currencies should become one of the tools in the Cash and Voucher Assistance toolbox.</p>

                <p class="re-small-font">We describe a dataset of account information and transaction records for a
                    digital community currency in Kenya. One unit of “Sarafu” is roughly equivalent in value to a Kenyan
                    shilling. The Sarafu system has existed since 2010 and began operating digitally via USSD
                    feature-code cellular technology in 2017. This dataset includes pseudonymized account information
                    for around 55,000 users and records of all Sarafu transactions conducted from 25/01/2020 to
                    15/06/2021. User transactions capture various economic and financial activities such as purchases,
                    transfers, and participation in savings and lending groups. So-called "chamas" are key to the
                    operation of the Sarafu system and clearly labeled in the data. This dataset will contribute to
                    research on the operation of community currencies, monetary systems, and economic networks in
                    underdeveloped areas. The observation period includes the first year of the coronavirus pandemic and
                    several documented pilot projects and development interventions.</p>

                <p class="re-small-font">In 2020, Grassroots Economics’ Community Inclusion Currency (CIC) model was
                    adopted by the Kenya Red
                    Cross as a humanitarian response to the Covid-19 pandemic. This paper presents the results of what
                    may be the world’s first randomized control trial in this area. Unlike most cash transfer programs,
                    recipients are sent cryptocurrencies rather than cash or mobile money, enabling an unprecedented
                    level of impact evaluation. Results show that CIC transfers of $30 are associated with $93.51
                    increase in beneficiaries’ wallet balance, a $23.17 increase in monthly income, a $16.30 increase in
                    monthly spending, a $6.31 increase in average trade size and a $28.43 increase in expenditure on
                    food and water. However, the difference in treatment effects for males versus females suggests
                    gender imbalances persist. This study serves as an important prototype for cash transfer models that
                    keep money flowing locally and support bottom-up economic resilience.</p>

                <p> Community currencies are used all over the world, but only sometimes economically ad- vantageous. We
                    introduce liquidity to the debate as a new explanation of success. After developing a working
                    hypothesis, we use two case studies to test it. We find community currencies are only economically
                    advantageous in an environment of insufficient liquidity.</p>
